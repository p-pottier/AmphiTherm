TI  - Influence of environment on thermal ecology of direct-developing frogs (Anura: craugastoridae: pristimantis) in the eastern Andes of Colombia
AU  - Bernal Castro, E. A.
AB  - Amphibian's temperature is a critical variable in the biology and ecology of organisms, especially ectotherms whose body temperatures depend on environmental conditions. In this study we compared the thermal biology of 13 species of frogs of the genus Pristimantis across 11 sites across different elevations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia, and sought to correlate ecophysiological variation with environmental variation at two scales. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) temperatures of reach frog, along with air temperature, and microhabitat temperature and structure. As the height of the locality increases, CTMin decreases in greater scale in relation to the CTMax, which is high in relation to the maximum temperature reported for highlands. There are also differences in thermal physiology between the flanks of the mountain range. The variables of herbaceous cover, litter cover and Humidity are related to the thermal limits of the species. The changes in thermal physiology include a dynamic that involves not only altitudinal and latitudinal changes, but also the structure and composition of the microhabitats that each species inhabits, as well as the evolutionary history of the species, which can contribute to the conservation of characters such as the CTMax in highland species, which, in turn, raises new questions regarding the survival of species in the face of climate change phenomena.

TI  - Thermal tolerance and sensitivity of amphibian larvae from Palearctic and Neotropical communities
AU  - Katzenberger, Marco
AB  - Amphibians across the world are threatened by climate change. This work deals with the analysis of thermal tolerance and sensitivity and their latitudinal variation at the community level, with the intent of examining the prediction that tropical amphibians are at higher risk of extinction due to global warming than temperate species since their environmental temperatures are closer to their upper thermal limits. To test this prediction, two larval amphibian communities were selected from contrasting latitudes: subtropical (Argentina) and temperate Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula) climates. In both locations, the following key parameters were obtained: 1) environmental pond temperatures (Thab), by monitoring ponds at different locations using water dataloggers; 2) critical thermal maximum, using a dynamic method called CTmax or knockdown temperature, to assess how close environmental temperatures are from their upper thermal limit; and 3) optimum temperature (Topt), by analysing tadpole’s maximum swimming speed at different temperatures and building thermal performance curves (TPCs), to determine how changes in environmental temperatures will affect the ability to perform ecologically relevant functions and therefore their general fitness. Warming Tolerance (WT) (WT=CTmax-Thab) and Thermal Safety Margins (TSM) (TSM=Topt-Thab) were also calculated for all species. Analyses of CTmax and optimal performance temperature indicate that species have adapted their critical and optimal temperatures to cope with environmental conditions. Species exposed to higher maximum or average temperatures usually have higher CTmax or optimum temperatures, respectively. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between these traits. Results also show that Argentinean subtropical species, although having higher CTmax and optimum temperature values, have lower WT and narrower TSM. Therefore, these species generally appear to be in greater extinction risk than temperate species from the Iberian Peninsula, under predicted scenarios of rising temperatures and climate change

TI  - Days of futures past : integrating physiology, microenvironments, and biogeographic history to predict response of frogs in neotropical dry-forest to global warming
AU  - Castellanos García, Luisa Alej
AB  - Global climate is changing at an accelerated rate with a predicted increase in temperature of up to 5°C by 2070. Species present in biomes already exposed to high temperatures could be near their thermal limit, and further temperature increase could threaten their survival. Organisms directly experience micro-environments rather than regional temperatures, however. Thus, predicting the response of species to climate change requires understanding how variation in regional temperatures relates to variation in the micro-environment, as well as understanding a species' physiological tolerance to thermal extremes. Finally, understanding how readily a species' thermal niche could evolve to new conditions, is informed by inferring the historical labiality of this trait in a comparative phylogenetic context. We applied this integrative approach to the study of two sympatric frog species (Anura: Leptodactylidae: Leiuperinae) from the xeric lowlands of the Caribbean Coast of South America: the Colombian four-eyed frog, Pleurodema brachyops, and the túngara frog...

TI  - Impact of climate change on Singapore amphibians
AU  - Daniel, NG Jia Jun
AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened of all vertebrate groups and climate change has been partially implicated to their disappearance. Temperature increase and increased rainfall variability are particularly detrimental to them as a result of their unique life history and physiology. Tropical amphibians are especially vulnerable as they are believed to be close to their physiological limits. In my study, I assessed which species are most vulnerable to climate change; determined whether drastic declines are also occurring locally; investigated warming vulnerability between different amphibian communities; ascertained the individual effect of elevated temperature and its interactive effect with low pH. The main findings suggest that while some species may be more tolerant than previously hypothesised, others appear to be vulnerable. In addition, synergistic interaction between high temperature and low pH can reduce survival. These findings will have implications on their future survival and how conservation efforts should be directed towards them.

AU  - Yandún Vela, María Carolina
AB  - Cuando la temperatura ambiental cambia en un ecosistema, los organismos tienen distintas opciones para sobrellevar la modificación. La capacidad de aclimatación es una de ellas. El cambio climático actual puede estar causando declinaciones en las poblaciones de anfibios y el estudio de las tolerancias térmicas de este grupo puede permitir mejorar estrategias de conservación para las especies que se pueden ver más afectadas. En el presente estudio, dos especies de anuros, Rhinella marina y Gastrotheca riobambae, fueron expuestas a distintos tratamientos de aclimatación (14 ºC, 20 ºC, 26 ºC, 32 ºC y 36 ºC) y se obtuvo sus tolerancias térmicas para analizar si estas especies poseen capacidad de aclimatación, calculada mediante el Radio de Respuesta de Aclimatación (ARR), y evaluar su vulnerabilidad relativa al cambio climático. Los resultados mostraron una respuesta de aclimatación positiva para ambas especies, R. marina tuvo un ARRMAX=0.2 que indica que tiene más capacidad de aclimatación hacia el calor que G. riobambae con ARRMAX=0.12. Para el ARRMIN, el resultado fue mayor aclimatación para el frío de G. riobambae. Esta especie mostró también tener el rango de tolerancia más amplio con 40 grados de amplitud térmica, y menor vulnerabilidad relativa al cambio climático con WT=23.6 grados.

AB  - Temperature and water availability are factors that affect, importantly, the ecology, physiology, and behavior of amphibians. In this sense, these animals need to present a number of ecophysiological characteristics that allows them to cope with potentially challenging environmental features. In this thesis, I aimed to explore different topics (ecological gradients, diseases, and activity) focusing on the thermal physiology and water balance of anuran amphibians. The first chapter presents a general introduction focused on one of the central themes of this thesis, the thermal physiology of amphibians. However, this chapter also explores the inter-relationship between body temperature regulation and water balance. The second chapter investigates whether or not physiological traits associated to thermal tolerances and water balance, in five anuran amphibians, vary along elevational gradients along two mountain ranges, Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The third chapter examines the potential effects of chytridomycosis - an emerging fungal disease claimed to cause amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide due to cutaneous osmoregulatory disorders - on the water balance and mortality of anuran species from Brazil. The fourth chapter investigates whether or not the diurnal activity of dispersing juveniles of the burrowing frog, Dermatonotus muelleri, might be correlated with physiological traits associated to thermal physiology and water balance

AB  - We provide data to support the onset of spasms (OS) as the definitive end point for determining thermal tolerance with the critical thermal maximum (CTMax). We measured the CTMax of 610 animals in three vertebrate classes, Actinopterygii, Amphibia, and Reptilia. All showed a significantly lower mean loss of righting response (LRR) than OS. Statistical evaluation of the variability associated with the end points LRR and OS also showed that OS is a more precise measure of thermal tolerance. OS is a more meaningful end point than LRR because it more closely fits the original definition of the critical thermal maximum (R.B. Cowles and C.M. Bogeft. 1944. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. 83:261-296) and Occurs at temperatures required for physiological responses, such as heat-hardening and perhaps the production of some heat-shock proteins. The adoption of OS as a standard end point would allow valid comparisons of data from different studies and among taxa, an important consideration for comparative phylogenetic analyses. However, we suggest that LRR should also be measured for comparisons with data from earlier studies.

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as unusually hot or dry conditions, can cause death by exceeding physiological limits, and so cause loss of population. Survival will depend on whether or not susceptible organisms can find refuges that buffer extreme conditions. Microhabitats offer different microclimates to those found within the wider ecosystem, but do these microhabitats effectively buffer extreme climate events relative to the physiological requirements of the animals that frequent them? We collected temperature data from four common microhabitats (soil, tree holes, epiphytes, and vegetation) located from the ground to canopy in primary rainforests in the Philippines. Ambient temperatures were monitored from outside of each microhabitat and from the upper forest canopy, which represent our macrohabitat controls. We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of frog and lizard species, which are thermally sensitive and inhabit our microhabitats. Microhabitats reduced mean temperature by 1-2 °C and reduced the duration of extreme temperature exposure by 14-31 times. Microhabitat temperatures were below the CTmax of inhabitant frogs and lizards, whereas macrohabitats consistently contained lethal temperatures. Microhabitat temperatures increased by 0.11-0.66 °C for every 1 °C increase in macrohabitat temperature, and this nonuniformity in temperature change influenced our forecasts of vulnerability for animal communities under climate change. Assuming uniform increases of 6 °C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 32-fold, whereas under nonuniform increases of 0.66 to 3.96 °C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 108-fold. Microhabitats have extraordinary potential to buffer climate and likely reduce mortality during extreme climate events. These results suggest that predicted changes in distribution due to mortality and habitat shifts that are derived from macroclimatic samples and that assume uniform changes in microclimates relative to macroclimates may be overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, even nonuniform temperature increases within buffered microhabitats would still threaten frogs and lizards. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Predicting the biodiversity impacts of global warming implies that we know where and with what magnitude these impacts will be encountered. Amphibians are currently the most threatened vertebrates, mainly due to habitat loss and to emerging infectious diseases. Global warming may further exacerbate their decline in the near future, although the impact might vary geographically. We predicted that subtropical amphibians should be relatively susceptible to warming-induced extinctions because their upper critical thermal limits (CT max) might be only slightly higher than maximum pond temperatures (T max). We tested this prediction by measuring CT max and T max for 47 larval amphibian species from two thermally distinct subtropical communities (the warm community of the Gran Chaco and the cool community of Atlantic Forest, northern Argentina), as well as from one European temperate community. Upper thermal tolerances of tadpoles were positively correlated (controlling for phylogeny) with maximum pond temperatures, although the slope was steeper in subtropical than in temperate species. CT max values were lowest in temperate species and highest in the subtropical warm community, which paradoxically, had very low warming tolerance (CT max-T max) and therefore may be prone to future local extinction from acute thermal stress if rising pond T max soon exceeds their CT max. Canopy-protected subtropical cool species have larger warming tolerance and thus should be less impacted by peak temperatures. Temperate species are relatively secure to warming impacts, except for late breeders with low thermal tolerance, which may be exposed to physiological thermal stress in the coming years. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - It is often assumed that ecological interactions happen at rapid rates relative to evolutionary change. In this study we examined the development and physiology of an amphibian (Rana sylvatica) from populations found in forested wetlands, and from wetlands that had been cleared by reinvading beaver (Castor canadensis). Embryos from beaver wetlands hatched at lower rates when raised in a shaded, common garden setting compared with embryos from forested wetlands. Larvae from beaver wetlands had higher critical thermal maxima compared with conspecifics from forested wetlands. These patterns suggest that R. sylvatica populations may have diverged rapidly (in less than 36 years) in response to changes in their environment induced by another species. Other agents of thermal change, such as anthropogenic landscape conversion or alteration of global Climate, could have analogous impacts on wetland dependent species such as amphibians.

T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Rising temperatures, a widespread consequence of climate change, have been implicated in enigmatic amphibian declines from habitats with little apparent human impact. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Human activities often replace native forests with warmer, modified habitats that represent novel thermal environments for biodiversity. Reducing biodiversity loss hinges upon identifying which species are most sensitive to the environmental conditions that result from habitat modification. Drawing on case studies and a meta-analysis, we examined whether observed and modelled thermal traits, including heat tolerances, variation in body temperatures, and evaporative water loss, explained variation in sensitivity of ectotherms to habitat modification. Low heat tolerances of lizards and amphibians and high evaporative water loss of amphibians were associated with increased sensitivity to habitat modification, often explaining more variation than non-thermal traits. Heat tolerances alone explained 24–66% (mean = 38%) of the variation in species responses, and these trends were largely consistent across geographic locations and spatial scales. As habitat modification alters local microclimates, the thermal biology of species will likely play a key role in the reassembly of terrestrial communities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

T2  - Global Change Biology
AB  - Habitat conversion is a major driver of the biodiversity crisis, yet why some species undergo local extinction while others thrive under novel conditions remains unclear. We suggest that focusing on species' niches, rather than traits, may provide the predictive power needed to forecast biodiversity change. We first examine two Neotropical frog congeners with drastically different affinities to deforestation and document how thermal niche explains deforestation tolerance. The more deforestation-tolerant species is associated with warmer macroclimates across Costa Rica, and warmer microclimates within landscapes. Further, in laboratory experiments, the more deforestation-tolerant species has critical thermal limits, and a jumping performance optimum, shifted ~2 °C warmer than those of the more forest-affiliated species, corresponding to the ~3 °C difference in daytime maximum temperature that these species experience between habitats. Crucially, neither species strictly specializes on either habitat - instead habitat use is governed by regional environmental temperature. Both species track temperature along an elevational gradient, and shift their habitat use from cooler forest at lower elevations to warmer deforested pastures upslope. To generalize these conclusions, we expand our analysis to the entire mid-elevational herpetological community of southern Costa Rica. We assess the climatological affinities of 33 amphibian and reptile species, showing that across both taxonomic classes, thermal niche predicts presence in deforested habitat as well as or better than many commonly used traits. These data suggest that warm-adapted species carry a significant survival advantage amidst the synergistic impacts of land-use conversion and climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Land-cover and climate change are both expected to alter species distributions and contribute to future biodiversity loss. However, the combined effects of land-cover and climate change on assemblages, especially at the landscape scale, remain understudied. Lowland tropical amphibians may be particularly susceptible to changes in land cover and climate warming because many species have narrow thermal safety margins resulting from air and body temperatures that are close to their critical thermal maxima (CTmax). We examined how changing thermal landscapes may alter the area of thermally suitable habitat (TSH) for tropical amphibians. We measured microclimates in 6 land-cover types and CTmax of 16 frog species in lowland northeastern Costa Rica. We used a biophysical model to estimate core body temperatures of frogs exposed to habitat-specific microclimates while accounting for evaporative cooling and behavior. Thermally suitable habitat area was estimated as the portion of the landscape where species CTmax exceeded their habitat-specific maximum body temperatures. We projected changes in TSH area 80 years into the future as a function of land-cover change only, climate change only, and combinations of land-cover and climate-change scenarios representing low and moderate rates of change. Projected decreases in TSH area ranged from 16% under low emissions and reduced forest loss to 30% under moderate emissions and business-as-usual land-cover change. Under a moderate emissions scenario (A1B), climate change alone contributed to 1.7- to 4.5-fold greater losses in TSH area than land-cover change only, suggesting that future decreases in TSH from climate change may outpace structural habitat loss. Forest-restricted species had lower mean CTmax than species that occurred in altered habitats, indicating that thermal tolerances will likely shape assemblages in changing thermal landscapes. In the face of ongoing land-cover and climate change, it will be critical to consider changing thermal landscapes in strategies to conserve ectotherm species. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - Aim: Under the Hutchinsonian concept of the realized niche, biotic interactions and dispersal limitation may prevent species from fully occupying areas that they could tolerate physiologically. This can hamper the translation of physiological limits into climatically defined range limits and distorts inferences of evolutionary changes of the adaptive limits (i.e. niche conservatism). In contrast, heritable physiological limits should conform more closely to the position of the niche in the climatic hyperspace. Here, we hypothesize that a measure of niche position in the climatic hyperspace is more reliable than niche boundaries to capture the variability and evolutionary pattern of physiological tolerance. Location: Neotropics and Palaeartic. Methods: We used phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions to test the relationships between physiological requirements and macroecological niche features (i.e. based on known species distributions) among anurans. We use larval critical thermal maximum (CTmax) as a measure of physiological response and maximum temperature (Tmax), temperature variability (Tvar) and the position and breadth of niche in climatic hyperspace as measures of the realized niche in geographical space. We also compare evolutionary rates among these parameters using the phylogenetic signal representation curve. Results: CTmax is better correlated with niche position (r2=0.414) than with Tvar, and CTmax is unrelated to either Tmax or niche breadth. CTmax and macroecological niche position also show similar and rapid evolutionary rates, i.e. faster than Brownian motion, whereas Tmax and Tvar evolve more slowly and niche breadth evolves at random. Main conclusions: The transferability between thermal tolerance and realized climatic niche limits is weak. Only macroecological niche position in the multivariate climatic hyperspace correlates with physiological tolerance. It thus appears to be more suitable for describing the variability and evolutionary pattern of the species' adaptive limits. We link these results to 'niche dimensionality', in that multiple interacting factors outweigh single factors in demarcating the species' realized climatic niche, thereby determining the conserved upper thermal limits of the species. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Species may circumvent the impacts of climate warming if the habitats they use reduce ambient temperature. In this study, we identified which frog species from a tropical montane rain forest in the Philippines may be vulnerable to climate warming. To do so, we selected five anuran species that utilize four breeding habitats and identified the sensitivity and exposure of tadpoles and direct-developer eggs to heat by measuring their critical thermal maximums (CTmax) and the habitat-specific temperatures they experience. Our study species included two direct-developer frogs-one species that lays its eggs on exposed leaves, and another that lays its eggs in ferns-and three species that produce aquatic free-swimming tadpoles-two stream breeders, and one phytotelm (tree hole) breeder. We compared thermal tolerances derived from microclimates of breeding habitats with tolerances derived from macroclimate (i.e., non-buffered air temperature taken from the rain forest canopy). We also examined whether differences in CTmax existed across life-history stages (egg, metamorph/young-of-year, and adult) for the two direct-developer frog species. Habitats buffered ambient temperature and expanded thermal tolerances of all frog species. We found that direct-developers, however, are more vulnerable to increased temperatures than aquatic breeders-indicated by their high sensitivity to temperature, and exposure to high temperatures. Direct-developer eggs were more sensitive to warming than both metamorph and adult life-history stages. Thermally buffered microhabitats may represent the only protection against current and impending climate warming. Our data highlight the importance of considering sensitivity and exposure in unison when deciphering warming vulnerability of frogs. © 2013 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.

Critical thermal maxima, onset of spasms, hot and cold lethals and rate and range of acclimation have been determined for forty-two species of anurans from a wide variety of habitats, latitudes and altitudes along the east coast of Australia. 2. 2. Cryophylic anurans are more southern and thermophylic anurans more northern in distribution, though both stenothermic and eurythermic frogs may occur at any latitude. 3. 3. Species with restricted geographic ranges have little or poor ability to physiologically adjust. Species with wide ranges of adaptability have the widest geographic range. © 1970.

AB  - Aim: The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) states that a positive relationship may exist between the breadth of thermal tolerance range and the level of climatic variability experienced by taxa with increasing latitude, especially in terrestrial ectotherms. Under CVH, we expected to find a correspondence between both thermal tolerance limits (CTmax and CTmin), ambient extreme temperature and the range sizes of species. We examined the validity of these predictions in a lowland tropical and a temperate tadpole assemblage. Location: Lowland Neotropics (Bahia, Brazil) and Palaearctic (Iberian Peninsula and North Africa). Method: We employed phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) and Pagel's lambda to analyse phylogenetic signals in CTmax and CTmin. We used phylogenetic regression analyses (PGLS) to test the relationships between thermal limits, range size and temperature predictors (measured at the macroscale and microhabitat levels) and phy-ANOVA to compare both the physiological traits and thermal regimen in both tropical and temperate assemblages. Results: We documented moderate-to-strong phylogenetic signal in both heat and cold tolerance. Temperate-zone tadpoles had broader thermal tolerances than tropical ones. Thermal tolerance range was correlated with range sizes and was explained by seasonal thermal range predictors at the global scale. Both macro- and microclimate temperature variables provided the best predictive multivariate models of thermal limits at the global scale. Microclimatic predictors, however, were the main determinants of CTmax and CTmin variation at the local level of tropical and temperate communities respectively. Main conclusions: Thermal tolerance range increases with latitude in tadpoles due to the higher increase in cold tolerance in temperate tadpoles. At the global scale, both macro- and microenvironment thermal information were reliable predictors of critical thermal limits and thermal tolerance range, as CVH predicts. However, thermal limits were best predicted by temperatures of the micro-habitat at the regional level, thus suggesting that physiological thermal boundaries may be governed by thermal selection. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Although temperature variation is known to cause large-scale adaptive divergence, its potential role as a selective factor over microgeographic scales is less well-understood. Here, we investigated how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms) traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the presence of gene flow. © 2015, Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Diurnal activity is characteristic of many toad species, including Bufo granulosus from the Brazilian semi-arid biome called the Caatinga. Because of their patterns of activity, juvenile toads are exposed to hot and dehydrating conditions. Our investigation focuses on temperature and water relationships, and is based on the prediction that anuran diurnal activity in a semi-arid environment must be associated with morphological, physiological and behavioral traits enhancing thermal tolerances, capacity for performance at high temperatures and water balance. To test specific hypothesis related with this prediction, we investigated postmetamorphic B. granulosus and collected data on thermal tolerances and preferences, thermal safety margins, thermal dependence of locomotor behavior, thermal and kinetic properties of citrate synthase (CS), and skin morphophysiology. This information was compared with additional data from adult conspecifics and adult toads from sympatric species or from species from more moderate environments. We found that juvenile B. granulosus exhibit the highest critical maximum temperature reported for toads (44.2 °C) and are well suited to move at high temperatures. However, and in contrast with juveniles of other Bufo species, they do not show thermal preferences in a gradient and appear to hydroregulate more than thermoregulate. The CS of adult and juvenile toads shows typical patterns of thermal sensibility, but the thermal stability of this enzyme is much higher in juveniles than in adult Bufo of any other species studied. The inguinal skin exhibits a complex folding pattern and seems highly specialized for capillary water uptake. Diurnal activity in juvenile B. granulosus is possible given high thermal tolerances, keen ability to detect and uptake water, and avoidance behaviors. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Photoperiod acclimation and 24-hour variations in the critical thermal maxima of a tropical and a temperate frog
AU  - Mahoney, J.J.
AU  - Hutchison, V.H.
T2  - Oecologia
AB  - The effect of photoperiod on the upper thermal tolerance of two species of frogs was studied by using the critical thermal maximum (CTM) as the end point. Both species are heliotropic and from temperate climates, but Hyla labialis lives under a near constant tropical photoperiod while Rana pipiens lives under a varying temperatezone photoperiod. The CTM of both species was studied over a 24-hour period to determine if a rhythm of temperature tolerance exists. In all but one of the acclimatization conditions used, the CTM of R. pipiens was higher than that of H. labialis. This agrees with what is known of their thermal ecology. Photoperiod significantly affects the CTM of both species. For Rana pipiens long (LD 16:8) photoperiods result in significantly higher thermal tolerance than short (LD 8:16) or moderate (LD 12:12) photoperiods at both 15 and 25° C. H. labialis shows a different pattern, having highest CTM at 25°C, LD 12:12 and lowest at 15°C, LD 12:12. When acclimated to a short (LD 8:16) photoperiod certain aspects of the frogs' tolerance of high temperatures are altered. At the same acclimatization the CTM of R. pipiens is higher than that of H. labialis, except under a combination short light regime and low temperature, and H. labialis at LD 8:16 shows no thermal acclimation between 15 and 25°C. Significant variation in the CTM over a 24-hour period occurred in H. labialis acclimatized at 25°C, LD 12:12 and R. pipiens at 25°C, LD 8:16 and 15°C, LD 12:12. For both species the 24-hour rhythm of temperature tolerance, when it occurs at LD 12:12, might be of adaptive value. Times of highest thermal tolerance are in the late morning or early afternoon and lowest tolerance is during the dark period. For R. pipiens under the unnatural combination of 25°C, LD 8:16, the pattern is reversed. When all three significant cycles are phase shifted so that the times of highest tolerance coincide, the pattern of the curves is very similar. © 1969 Springer-Verlag.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Tropical ectothermic species are currently depicted as more vulnerable to increasing temperatures because of the proximity between their upper thermal limits and environmental temperatures. Yet, the acclimatory capacity of thermal limits has rarely been measured in tropical species, even though they are generally predicted to be smaller than in temperate species. We compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and warming tolerance (WT: the difference between CTmax and maximum temperature, Tmax), as well as CTmax acclimatory capacity of toad species from the Atlantic forest (AF) and the Brazilian Caatinga (CAA), a semi-arid habitat with high temperatures. Acclimation temperatures represented the mean temperatures of AF and CAA habitats, making estimates of CTmax and WT more ecologically realistic. CAA species mean CTmax was higher compared to AF species in both acclimation treatments. Clutches within species, as well as between AF and CAA species, differed in CTmax plasticity and we discuss the potential biological meaning of these findings. We did not find a trade-off between absolute CTmax and CTmax plasticity, indicating that species can have both high CTmax and high CTmax plasticity. Although CTmax was highly correlated to Tmax, CTmax plasticity was not related to Tmax or Tmax coefficients of variation. CAA species mean WT was lower than for AF species, but still very high for all species, diverging from other studies with tropical species. This might be partially related to over-estimation of vulnerability due to under-appreciation of realistic acclimation treatments in CTmax estimation. Thus, some tropical species might not be as vulnerable to warming as previously predicted if CTmax is considered as a shifting population parameter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Herpetologica
AB  - We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of tadpoles of Buergeria japonica inhabiting streams and geothermal hot springs. The CTMax of all B. japonica tadpoles was over 41 C, indicating that the tadpoles are heat-tolerant. At Rushan, we monitored the temporal and spatial distribution of tadpoles over a 24-h period in a 220 cm X 70 cm plot that is fed by a geothermal hot spring. The thermal profiles of the plot varied seasonally, but the highest water temperature selected by tadpoles remained similar (ca. 37 C). In the winter, the thermal range of the plot was lower (29.5-40.6 C), and tadpoles could be found in the majority of the plot. In contrast, during the spring and summer the temperature ranges of the plot were higher (33.1-43.8 C and 33.0-42.4 C, respectively), and tadpoles could be found only in the cooler sections of the plot, especially around 1000 h with direct solar radiation. These results suggest that extreme heat tolerance and behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., heat avoidance behavior) are the main means by which B. japonica tadpoles cope with the high temperatures in geothermal hot springs. © 2005 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.

AB  - Despite many studies demonstrating the effect of acclimation on behavioural or physiological traits, considerable debate still exists about the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon. One of the unresolved issues is whether acclimation to warmer temperature is beneficial at treatment or at more extreme test temperatures. To answer this question, we assessed the effect of thermal acclimation on preferred body temperatures (Tps), maximum swimming and running speed, and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in the Danube crested newt (Triturus dobrogicus). Adult newts were kept at 15°C (control) and 25°C (treatment) for 8 weeks prior to measurements. We measured Tps in an aquatic thermal gradient over 24 h, maximum speeds in a linear racetrack at six temperatures (5-33°C), and CTmax in a continuously heated water bath. Tps were higher in newts kept at 15°C than in those kept at 25°C. The maximum swimming speed did not acclimate. The maximum running speed at 30-33°C was substantially higher in newts kept at 25°C than in those kept at 15°C. CTmax increased with the treatment temperature. Hence, we conclude that the acclimation response to warm temperature is beneficial not at treatment but at more extreme temperatures in newts. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Rate of evaporation, resistance to drying, temperature selection, and critical thermal maximum were measured for Jamaican Eleutherodactylus acclimated to 20° C and a 12:12 L:D photoperiod. Two introduced species, E. planirostris and E. johnstonei, selected higher temperatures and had higher CTMs than two native species, E. cundalli and E. gossei. The introduced species lost water as rapidly as the native species, but tolerated 30-73% greater water loss before losing their righting response. The physiological differences are reflected in the microhabitat selection and activity patterns of the four species. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Critical thermal limits are thought to be correlated with the elevational distribution of species living in tropical montane regions, but with upper limits being relatively invariant compared to lower limits. To test this hypothesis, we examined the variation of thermal physiological traits in a group of terrestrial breeding frogs (Craugastoridae) distributed along a tropical elevational gradient. We measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax; n = 22 species) and critical thermal minimum (CTmin; n = 14 species) of frogs captured between the Amazon floodplain (250 m asl) and the high Andes (3,800 m asl). After inferring a multilocus species tree, we conducted a phylogenetically informed test of whether body size, body mass, and elevation contributed to the observed variation in CTmax and CTmin along the gradient. We also tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of change given that critical thermal limits (and their plasticity) may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints along the gradient. Variation of critical thermal traits was significantly correlated with species’ elevational midpoint, their maximum and minimum elevations, as well as the maximum air temperature and the maximum operative temperature as measured across this gradient. Both thermal limits showed substantial variation, but CTmin exhibited relatively faster rates of change than CTmax, as observed in other taxa. Nonetheless, our findings call for caution in assuming inflexibility of upper thermal limits and underscore the value of collecting additional empirical data on species’ thermal physiology across elevational gradients. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - 1. 1. The tailed frog is a stenotopic anuran found only in cold mountain stream habitats, whereas the Pacific treefrog is found in a wide variety of habitats which are thermally diverse. 2. 2. The critical thermal maximum (CTM) for Hyla regilla is significantly above that of Ascaphus truei at all acclimation temperatures. 3. 3. The incipient lethal temperature (ILT) for H. regilla is about 9°C higher than the corresponding value for A. truei. 4. 4. A truei tends to select a lower temperature in a thermal gradient than does H. regilla. 5. 5. These observed physiological and behavioral differences correlate well with the differences between the habitats of these two anuran species. © 1973.

AB  - Although the skin of most amphibians measured to date offers no resistance to evaporative water loss (EWL), some species, primarily arboreal frogs, produce skin secretions that increase resistance to EWL. At high air temperatures, it may be advantageous for amphibians to increase EWL as a means to decrease body temperature. In Australian hylid frogs, most species do not decrease their resistance at high air temperature, but some species with moderate resistance (at moderate air temperatures) gradually decrease resistance with increasing air temperature, and some species with high resistance (at moderate air temperatures) abruptly decrease resistance at high air temperatures. Lower skin resistance at high air temperatures decreases the time to desiccation, but the lower body temperatures allow the species to avoid their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) body temperatures. The body temperatures of species with low to moderate resistances to EWL that do not adjust resistance at high air temperatures do not warm to their CTMax, although for some species, this is because they have high CTMax values. As has been reported previously for resistance to EWL generally, the response pattern of change of EWL at high air temperatures has apparently evolved independently among Australian hylids. The mechanisms involved in causing resistance and changes in resistance are unknown. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - When dispersal is not an option to evade warming temperatures, compensation through behavior, plasticity, or evolutionary adaptation is essential to prevent extinction. In this work, we evaluated whether there is physiological plasticity in the thermal performance curve (TPC) of maximum jumping speed in individuals acclimated to current and projected temperatures and whether there is an opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert landscape where inhabits the northernmost population of the endemic frog Pleurodema thaul. Our results indicate that individuals acclimated to 20°C and 25°C increased the breath of their TPCs by shifting their upper limits with respect to when they were acclimated at 10°C. In addition, even when dispersal is not possible for this population, the landscape is heterogeneous enough to offer opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. In particular, under current climatic conditions, behavioral thermoregulation is not compulsory as available operative temperatures are encompassed within the population TPC limits. However, for severe projected temperatures under climate change, behavioral thermoregulation will be required in the sunny patches. In overall, our results suggest that this population of Pleurodema thaul will be able to endure the worst projected scenario of climate warming as it has not only the physiological capacities but also the environmental opportunities to regulate its body temperature behaviorally. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - We compared the reproductive phenology and tadpole thermal physiology of two populations of Buergeria japonica in Taiwan. The population in Jentse breeds in a geothermal hot spring whose water is a warm, over 35°C year-round, whereas the population in Chukou breeds in a stream whose water temperature is closely correlated with fluctuations in air temperature and averages 23°C. The B. japonica population in Jentse breeds year-round, but the Chukou population breeds only from March to October. Tadpoles from Jentse that reared at 32°C attained larger sizes than tadpoles from Chukou that reared at 32°C, whereas tadpoles from both sites attained similar body size when reared at 22°C. Chukou tadpoles reared at 40°C died within 1-2 d, whereas Jentse tadpoles survived for 9 d at 40°C. All tadpoles tolerated heat well, but Jentse tadpoles had higher critical thermal maxima (CTMax) than Chukou tadpoles. Tadpoles from Jentse showed no metabolic compensation but those from Chukou showed an "inverse" metabolic compensation. Results suggest that B. japonica that breed in the geothermal hot spring has a prolonged breeding season, high growth rates and the reduction or absence of intra-and inter-specific competition. Evolution of a high level of heat tolerance and, possibly, behavioral temperature selection, enable tadpoles in the hotsprings to offset the thermal stress imposed by warm water.

The desiccation tolerance of the introduced tropical toad Bufo marinus is similar to other terrestrial anuran amphibians (52·6 per cent of total body water), while the resistance to the hydration stress of distilled water is that of an aquatic anuran. 2. 2. The critical thermal maxima of ca. 40°C for adults and 42°C for larvae are high enough so that high ambient temperatures are not limiting. 3. 3. The lower temperature limit (below 10°C) permits continued survival in its present South Florida range, but shifting of this limit must occur before the range can expand into temperate Florida. © 1970.

AB  - To forecast biological responses to changing environments, we need to understand how a species's physiology varies through space and time and assess how changes in physiological function due to environmental changes may interact with phenotypic changes caused by other types of environmental variation. Amphibian larvae are well known for expressing environmentally induced phenotypes, but relatively little is known about how these responses might interact with changing temperatures and their thermal physiology. To address this question, we studied the thermal physiology of grey treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) by determining whether exposures to predator cues and an herbicide (Roundup) can alter their critical maximum temperature (CTmax) and their swimming speed across a range of temperatures, which provides estimates of optimal temperature (Topt) for swimming speed and the shape of the thermal performance curve (TPC). We discovered that predator cues induced a 0.4°C higher CTmax value, whereas the herbicide had no effect. Tadpoles exposed to predator cues or the herbicide swam faster than control tadpoles and the increase in burst speed was higher near Topt. In regard to the shape of the TPC, exposure to predator cues increased Topt by 1.5°C, while exposure to the herbicide marginally lowered Topt by 0.4°C. Combining predator cues and the herbicide produced an intermediate Topt that was 0.5°C higher than the control. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a predator altering the thermal physiology of amphibian larvae (prey) by increasing CTmax, increasing the optimum temperature, and producing changes in the thermal performance curves. Furthermore, these plastic responses of CTmax and TPC to different inducing environments should be considered when forecasting biological responses to global warming. © 2014 Katzenberger et al.

The CTM of progressively larger (older) postmetamorphic or juvenile toads gradually increases until the adult CTM of 41.1°C is attained. 3. 3. This gradual increase in CTM from juvenile to adult toad suggests that the physiological systems underlying thermal tolerance change or mature following metamorphosis until the adult condition is reached. 4. 4.

AB  - 1. 1. Metabolic rate and critical thermal maximum (CTM) were studied in three groups of carpenter frogs, Rana virgatipes, acclimated to 5, 15 and 25°C, respectively. 2. 2. Metabolic rate increased with test temperature in all acclimation groups and, over the range of temperatures tested (5-25°C), Q10 was positively correlated with acclimation temperature. 3. 3. Acclimation produced no statistically significant differences in the metabolic performance of the three groups at test temperatures of 5 and 15 °C; at 25°C, the group acclimated to that temperature had a significantly higher rate of metabolism than the other two groups. 4. 4. CTM varied directly with acclimation temperature and was significantly different among the three groups. 5. 5. The inconsistency between metabolic rate data and CTM data as indices of thermal acclimation suggests that the physiological adjustments which mediate acclimation in one process are not identical to those which induce acclimation in the other. © 1973.

TI  - Low thermal tolerances of stream amphibians in the Pacific Northwest: Implications for riparian and forest management

T2  - Applied Herpetology
AB  - Temperature has a profound effect on survival and ecology of amphibians. In the Pacific Northwest, timber harvest is known to increase peak stream temperatures to 24°C or higher, which has potential to negatively impact cold-water stream amphibians. I determined the Critical Thermal Maxima (CT max) for two salamanders that are endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Rhyacotriton variegatus larvae acclimated at 10°C had mean CTmax of 26.7 ± 0.7 SD°C and adults acclimated at 11°C had mean CT max of 27.9 ± 1.1°C. These were among the lowest known values for any amphibian. Values were significantly higher for larval Dicamptodon tenebrosus acclimated at 14°C (x = 29.1 ± 0.2°C). Although the smallest R. variegatus had some of the lowest values, size of larvae and adults did not influence CTmax in this species. Current forest practices retain riparian buffers along larger fish-bearing streams; however, such buffers along smaller headwaters and non-fish bearing streams may provide favorable habitat conditions for coldwater-associated species in the Pacific Northwest. The current study lends further evidence to the need for protection of Northwest stream amphibians from environmental perturbations. Forest guidelines that include riparian buffer zones and configurations of upland stands should be developed, while monitoring amphibian responses to determine their success. © 2008 Brill Academic Publishers.

TI  - Low acclimation capacity of narrow-ranging thermal specialists exposes susceptibility to global climate change
AU  - Markle, T.M.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size among closely-related species with similar ecologies. Understanding this relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is associated with species’ latitudinal extents and the thermal range of the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically-controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide- and narrow-ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade-off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow-ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several narrow-ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and CTMax. Wide-ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for thermal acclimation than narrow-ranging species, suggesting that selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability. Further, given that narrow-ranging salamanders are found to have both poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated with anthropogenic climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Unprecedented global climate change and increasing rates of infectious disease emergence are occurring simultaneously. Infection with emerging pathogens may alter the thermal thresholds of hosts. However, the effects of fungal infection on host thermal limits have not been examined. Moreover, the influence of infections on the heat tolerance of hosts has rarely been investigated within the context of realistic thermal acclimation regimes and potential anthropogenic climate change. We tested for effects of fungal infection on host thermal tolerance in a model system: frogs infected with the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Infection reduced the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of hosts by up to ~4 °C. Acclimation to realistic daily heat pulses enhanced thermal tolerance among infected individuals, but the magnitude of the parasitism effect usually exceeded the magnitude of the acclimation effect. In ectotherms, behaviors that elevate body temperature may decrease parasite performance or increase immune function, thereby reducing infection risk or the intensity of existing infections. However, increased heat sensitivity from infections may discourage these protective behaviors, even at temperatures below critical maxima, tipping the balance in favor of the parasite. We conclude that infectious disease could lead to increased uncertainty in estimates of species' vulnerability to climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).

T2  - Journal of Experimental Biology
AB  - Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short-and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (20°C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24°C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32°C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Temperate-zone amphibians generally show an acclimation response of tolerance to high temperatures (CTMax). The Puerto Rican frog Eleutherodactylus portoricensis failed to show an acclimation response, but did show a negative correlation between elevation and CTMax. Subsequently, E. portoricensis, as originally understood, was found to consist of a widespread species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and a species restricted to high elevations (E. portoricensis). CTMax was determined for these 2 species. Differences previously believed to be attributable to elevation are, in fact, interspecific differences. There were no differences in CTMax of E. coqui from different elevations, but E. portoricensis had significantly lower CTMax. E. coqui failed to show an acclimation response. The few species of tropical amphibians that have been investigated suggest that, unlike most temperate-zone species, some tropical species fail to show an acclimation response, and some fail to show a negative correlation between CTMax and elevation. -from Authors

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity may buffer the selection pressures on organisms that inhabit novel or rapidly-changing environments. We investigated plasticity of thermal tolerance, energetic and water loss traits and their interaction with behaviour in a small-bodied, arboreal anuran (Hyperolius marmoratus Rapp, Hyperoliidae) undergoing rapid range expansion into the winter rainfall region of South Africa. After short-term exposure to three temperatures (acclimation treatments) commonly encountered in their historical and novel ranges, frogs exhibited a broad thermal tolerance range (mean±s.d.: 42.1±2.9°C) and higher plasticity in CTmax than in CTmin. Resting metabolic rate was lowest in cold-acclimated animals, while active metabolic rates were lowest in warm-acclimated frogs, likely reflecting compensation towards energy conservation. Evaporative water loss was not significantly altered by the acclimation treatments in either resting or active animals, indicating limited plasticity in this trait compared to metabolism. Our results suggest that plasticity of temperature limits and metabolism may benefit this species in variable environments such as those encountered in its expanded range. Lack of plasticity in water loss during resting and activity suggests that these frogs rely on their high cutaneous resistance and behavioural means to buffer climate variation. This study highlights the importance of synergistic interactions between physiology and behaviour in determining amphibian responses to temperature variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Sherman, E.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - 1. We studied heat hardening in tadpoles and juveniles of the temperate Bufo americanus and the subtropical Xenopus laevis by comparing the critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of heat-pretreated animals with the CTMax of control (non-pretreated) animals of the same developmental stages. 2. While premetamorphic tadpoles (Gosner stages 26-43) of both species exhibited heat hardening, metamorphosing B. americanus tadpoles (stages 44-45) were unable to heat harden and, in fact, exhibited a decrease in CTMax following pretreatment while metamorphosing X. laevis tadpoles still exhibited heat hardening. 3. This difference may reflect the more stressful nature of the more extensive metamorphosis of Bufo compared to that of Xenopus. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intraspecific geographic variation in thermal limits and acclimatory capacity in a wide distributed endemic frog
AU  - Barria, A.M.
AU  - Bacigalupe, L.D.
T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (TPref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and TPref, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3% for CTmin, 10% for CTmax and TPref, and 1% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Canadian Journal of Zoology
AB  - Anuran survival is strongly affected by exposure to high environmental temperatures. However, their upper thermal tolerances vary between species and within developmental stages. The aims of this research were to measure the median lethal temperature (LT50) of three anuran developmental stages (Gosner stages 10, 20, and 25) at a constant thermal regime, and of developing embryos (stage 10) until they became tadpoles (stage 25) exposed to daily peaks of temperatures between 1000 and 1600. Four Colombian species (Emerald-eyed Treefrog, Hypsiboas crepitans (Wied-Neuwied, 1824); Tungara Frog, Engystomops pustulosus (Cope, 1864); Rivero’s Toad, Rhinella humboldti (Gallardo, 1965); Emerald Glassfrog, Espadarana prosoblepon (Boettger, 1892)) were used in these experiments. An ontogenetic increase was observed in the upper thermal tolerance from embryos to tadpoles for all species studied. In addition, developing embryos exposed to peak temperatures showed a LT50 fairly close to the mean of the maximum habitat temperatures, particularly in H. crepitans and E. pustulosus that lay egg masses exposed directly to the sun. Environmental temperatures in the microhabitat of species studied showed values remarkably higher than their experimental LT50. Therefore, we postulate that rapid increases in environmental temperatures, as result of global or local changes, might be a critical factor for anuran survival, mainly during the embryonic stages when they are more sensitive to temperature. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonal changes in the thermal tolerances of the toad Rhinella arenarum (Bufonidae) in the Monte Desert of Argentina
AU  - Sanabria, E.A.

AU  - Martino, A.L.
T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - We studied the thermal tolerances of Rhinella arenarum during the dry and wet seasons of the Monte Desert in San Juan Province, Argentina. This toad had differences in CT max between dry and wet seasons, and the CT max values were higher in the wet season (Austral summer). Operative temperature, body temperature, environmental maximal temperature, and relative humidity were related to CT max, suggesting seasonal acclimatization of R. arenarum. Additionally, the CT max recorded for R. arenarum was 36.2°C, and the maximum ambient temperature recorded during the toads' activity time was 37°C. Also, the CT min recorded for R. arenarum was 5.3°C and the minimum environmental temperature recorded was 7.2°C. The wide thermal tolerance range recorded and the relationship between tolerance limits and the environmental extremes indicate that seasonal acclimatization is an effective mechanism by which toads can raise their thermal tolerance, allowing them to survive in the challenging conditions of the Monte Desert. Additional studies are needed to understand the relationship between the thermal tolerance of this desert amphibian and the environmental parameters that influence its thermal physiology. © 2012.

T2  - Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -- Part A: Physiology
AB  - 1. 1. Metabolic rates, temperature acclimation, lipid deposition and temperature tolerance were investigated in two species of hylid treefrogs, the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea) and the coastal plain (Cope's) gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis). 2. 2. The rate of oxygen consumption at rest differed between the two species only at 30°C; there was no difference in respiratory metabolism at lower ambient temperatures. 3. 3. Hyla cinerea generally completed metabolic acclimation earlier than H. chrysoscelis, particularly at high temperatures; both species appeared to be fully acclimated in 6 days or less. 4. 4. The gray treefrog is less tolerant of high ambient temperatures than the green treefrog; mean upper lethal temperature was 41.5°C for Hyla chrysoscelis and 43.7°C for H. cinerea. 5. 5. Metabolized energy was higher at high ambient temperatures (i.e. 29°C) for H. chrysoscelis than H. cinerea, while the reverse was true at 19°C. 6. 6. The coefficient of utilization (100 x metabolized energy/gross energy intake) did not vary significantly between species or within species over the ambient temperature range of 19-24°C; H. chrysoscelis had a significantly higher efficiency at 29°C. 7. 7. Lipid reserves were generally similar in the two species throughout the summer. 8. 8. Differences in behavior, seasonal variation in activity and timing of reproduction are all related to thermal physiology and may play a role in determining the distributional limits of the two species. © 1986.

AB  - Aim: We analysed elevational and microclimatic drivers of thermal tolerance diversity in a tropical mountain frog clade to test three macrophysiological predictions: less spatial variation in upper than lower thermal limits (Bretts’ heat-invariant hypothesis); narrower thermal tolerance ranges in habitats with less variation in temperature (Janzen's climatic variability hypothesis); and higher level of heat impacts at lower elevations. Location: Forest and open habitats through a 4,230-m elevational gradient across the tropical Andes of Ecuador. Method: We examined variability in critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) and thermal breadth (TB; CTmax–CTmin) in 21 species of Pristimantis frogs. Additionally, we monitored maximum and minimum temperatures at the local scale (tmax, tmin) and estimated vulnerability to acute thermal stress from heat (CTmax–tmax) and cold (tmin–CTmin), by partitioning thermal diversity into elevational and microclimatic variation. Results: Our results were consistent with Brett's hypothesis: elevation promotes more variation in CTmin and tmin than in CTmax and tmax. Frogs inhabiting thermally variable open habitats have higher CTmax and tmax and greater TBs than species restricted to forest habitats, which show less climatic overlap across the elevational gradient (Janzen's hypothesis). Vulnerability to heat stress was higher in open than forest habitats and did not vary with elevation. Main conclusions: We suggest a mechanistic explanation of thermal tolerance diversity in elevational gradients by including microclimatic thermal variation. We propose that the unfeasibility to buffer minimum temperatures locally may explain the rapid increase in cold tolerance (lower CTmin) with elevation. In contrast, the relative invariability in heat tolerance (CTmax) with elevation may revolve around the organisms’ habitat selection of open- and canopy-buffered habitats. Secondly, on the basis of microclimatic estimates, lowland and upland species may be equally vulnerable to temperature increase, which is contrary to the pattern inferred from regional interpolated climate estimators. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Adaptations of the reed frog Hyperolius viridiflavus (Amphibia, Anura, Hyperoliidae) to its arid environment - IV. Ecological significance of water economy with comments on thermoregulation and energy allocation
AU  - Geise, W.

T2  - Oecologia
AB  - After breeding African savanna dwelling reed-frogs of the "superspecies" Hyperolius viridiflavus face a severe dry season. The frogs withstand the adverse abiotic conditions in exposed positions, clinging to dry vegetation. Only juveniles (300-700 mg) are able to adjust water economy and metabolism to a prolonged dry season. Wet season frogs attain low levels of evaporative water loss (EWL) within 6-8 days after incipient water shortage. This time course is mainly determined by the animal's ability to lower metabolism and activity level to the minimum demands of a dry season. Barriers against diffusion of water which most probably are built up by the stratum corneum and/or the overlying film of dried mucus seem not to be essentially modified during adjustment to dry season conditions. Changeover to dry season physiology is greatly accelerated through preconditioning frogs to water shortage. Adult Hyperoliusare unable to reduce activity and metabolism as fast and effectively as juveniles. Most probably these are the main reasons for their very restricted survival capability under dry season conditions; the generally poor energy reserves after the breeding period may further shorten their survival time. At the critical thermal maximum (CTM) Hyperolius uses skin gland secretions for evaporative cooling. Acclimation effects and regulation of evaporative cooling within some 1/10° C help to employ limited water reserves very economically. Dry adapted, dehydrated frogs take up water, whenever available, via specialized skin areas. Rate of uptake is high and is mainly determined by the actual stage of dehydration. The onset of the water-balance-response is also affected by preconditioning. Survival time of small (<500 mg) estivating Hyperolius is limited by their water reserves.Due to their unfavourable surface to volume ratio they loserelatively more water by evaporation than larger conspecifics. Therefore, smaller specimens should allocate energy preferably to growth, until reducing EWL so far to survive the average periods between the rare precipitations. In larger frogs (>500 mg) the amount of stored energy determines maximal survival time. When a critical size is reached in postmetamorphic growth, a change in energy allocation from body growth to energy storage would improve prospects of survival and should therefore be expected. Species specific differences in regard to EWL and CTM indicate a strong correlation between physiological properties and ecological demands. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. 1. The induction and decay kinetics of rapid increases in thermal tolerance (heat hardening) in Eurycea bislineata following exposure to either Critical Thermal Maximum (CTM) or 1 h at 2° below CTM were similar. Thermal tolerance increased to a maximum within 1 1 2h post-heat treatment of either type, and returned to near the original level within 24 h. However, the one hour heat treatment resulted in a larger amount of heat hardening (0.9 vs 0.6°C at optimum development). 2. 2. Most Desmognathus ochrophaeus did not heat harden in response to either CTM or a one hour sub-CTM exposure. 3. 3. CTM was significantly higher in D. ochrophaeus (33.9°C) than in E. bislineata (33.2°C), whereas certain sub-CTM changes in behavior/coordination were lower in D. ochrophaeus. The importance of these sub-CTM changes is discussed. © 1987.

AB  - Abstract1.Hydrated and dehydrated juvenile western toads (Bufo boreas) were exposed for 24 hr to sublethal concentrations of the organophosphorus insecticides Abate®, fenthion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, methylparathion, and the insect growth regulator, Altosid®.2.The most pronounced reduction in temperature tolerance occurred with the exposure to the insecticide fenthion; exposure to Altosid® caused the least reduction in temperature tolerance.3.In most cases the temperature tolerances of the dehydrated toads were not lowered significantly, and in some cases, were higher than toads exposed in the hydrated condition to the same chemical and concentration suggesting that dehydrated toads were metabolizing the chemicals at a greater rate than hydrated animals.4.The thermal tolerance was lowered significantly by all chemicals tested against concentrations at least one-half the usual field concentrations.5.Control toads were more active than any of the treated individuals suggesting that other physiological responses were also affected. © 1976.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is an anuran toad species distributed latitudinal and altitudinal (1200-5000. m) from Peru to Argentina, inhabiting mountain valleys in the Andes. Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-metamorphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9. °C to crystallization temperatures below 0. °C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0. °C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (~35 °C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. © 2015.

AB  - Complex life-histories may promote the evolution of different strategies to allow optimal matching to the environmental conditions that organisms can encounter in contrasting environments. For ectothermic animals, we need to disentangle the role of stage-specific thermal tolerances and developmental acclimation to predict the effects of climate change on spatial distributions. However, the interplay between these mechanisms has been poorly explored. Here we study whether developmental larval acclimation to rearing temperatures affects the thermal tolerance of subsequent terrestrial stages (metamorphs and juveniles) in common frogs (Rana temporaria). Our results show that larval acclimation to warm temperatures enhances larval heat tolerance, but not thermal tolerance in later metamorphic and juvenile stages, which does not support the developmental acclimation hypothesis. Further, metamorphic and juvenile individuals exhibit a decline in thermal tolerance, which would confer higher sensitivity to extreme temperatures. Because thermal tolerance is not enhanced by larval developmental acclimation, these ‘risky’ stages may be forced to compensate through behavioural thermoregulation and short-term acclimation to face eventual heat peaks in the coming decades. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) is expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally, understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul. We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to acclimation at 10 and 20°C. We monitored survival during three separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear selection). © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - As ectotherms, amphibians may exhibit changes in their thermal biology associated with spatial and temporal environmental contingencies. However, our knowledge on how amphibian´s thermal biology responds to seasonal changes in the environment is restricted to a few species, mostly from temperate regions, in a marked contrast with the high species diversity found in the Neotropics. We investigated whether or not the seasonal variation in climatic parameters from a high-montane ombrophilous forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could lead to concurrent adjustments in the thermal biology of the terrestrial toad Rhinella icterica. We measured active body temperature (Tb) in the field, and preferred body temperature (Tpref) and thermal tolerance (critical thermal minimum, CTmin, and maximum, CTmax) in the laboratory, for toads collected at two distinct seasons: warm/wet and cold/dry. We also measured operative environmental temperatures (Te) using agar toad models coupled with dataloggers distributed in different microhabitats in the field to estimate accuracy (db) and effectiveness (E) of thermoregulation of the toads for both seasons. Toads had higher Tpref in the warm/wet season compared to the cold/dry season, even though no seasonal change occurred in field Tb's. In the warm/wet season, toads decreased the accuracy of thermoregulation and avoided thermally favorable microhabitats, while in the cold/dry season they increased the accuracy of thermoregulation and exhibited high degree of thermoconformity. This result may encompass thermoregulatory adjustments to seasonal changes in Te's, but may also reflect seasonal differences in compromises between Tb regulation and other ecologically relevant activities (reproduction, foraging). Toads did not exhibit changes in CTmin or CTmax, which indicates a low risk of exposure to extreme temperatures in this particular habitat, at both seasons, possibly combined with a low flexibility of this trait. Overall, our study shows seasonal acclimatization in some aspects of the thermal biology of the toad, R. icterica. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A species’ thermal sensitivity and its exposure to climate variation are key components in the prediction of its vulnerability to climate change. We tested the thermal sensitivity of a tropical amphibian that lives in a mild constant climate in which the thermal tolerance range is expected to closely match the experienced environmental temperature. The air temperature that this species is exposed to varies between 21.9 and 31.6°C with an annual mean of 27.2°C. We estimated the microhabitat water temperature variation under vegetation shade, which buffers the temperature by 1.8°C in relation to that of the air, and with open canopy, where the water was 1.9°C warmer than the air temperature. With broods of tadpoles split into five treatments (15°C, 21°C, 28°C, 31°C, and 33°C), we estimated the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) after at least 7 days of acclimation. Both CTMax (42.3°C) and CTMin (11.8°C) were more extreme than the temperature range estimated for the field. We estimated the optimum temperature (To = 28.8°C) and the thermal performance breadth (range: 23.3–34.1°C) based on growth rate (g/day). The animals were able to acclimate more extensively to cold than to warm temperatures. These performance curve traits closely matched the air temperature. The estimated vulnerability varied according to the microhabitat prediction model used. The combination of tadpole data on thermal sensitivity and macro- and microhabitat variation provides a necessary framework to understand the effects of climate change on tropical amphibians. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - We study the variation in thermal parameters in two contrasting populations Yungas Redbelly Toads (Melanophryniscus rubriventris) with different discrete color phenotypes comparing field body temperatures, critical thermal maximum and heating rates. We found significant differences in field body temperatures of the different morphs. Temperatures were higher in toads with a high extent of dorsal melanization. No variation was registered in operative temperatures between the study locations at the moment of capture and processing. Critical thermal maximum of toads was positively related with the extent of dorsal melanization. Furthermore, we founded significant differences in heating rates between morphs, where individuals with a high extent of dorsal melanization showed greater heating rates than toads with lower dorsal melanization. The color pattern-thermal parameter relationship observed may influence the activity patterns and body size of individuals. Body temperature is a modulator of physiological and behavioral functions in amphibians, influencing daily and seasonal activity, locomotor performance, digestion rate and growth rate. It is possible that some growth constraints may arise due to the relationship of color pattern-metabolism allowing different morphs to attain similar sizes at different locations instead of body-size clines. © 2014.

AB  - Body temperatures, critical thermal maxima, tolerance to water loss, and rehydration rates were measured for T. diurnus in the rain forest on Mt. Glorious, south-eastern Queensland. Body temperatures ranged from 13·6 to 22·8°C (mean 18·4 ±1·9°C) for adults and from 14·0 to 23·8°C (mean 19·8 ± 2·4°C) for juveniles. Body temperatures were significantly higher in juveniles. The critical thermal maximum for T. diurnus was 31 1 ± 1·2°C and ranged from 28·4 to 33·7°C. Minimal activity temperatures appear to be reached in winter months. The mean lethal water loss for T. diurnus was 26·2 ± 4·3% of the original weight; this species shows less tolerance to desiccation than other Australian anurans that have been studied. © 1971, CSIRO.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is one of the anuran species with the greatest presence in Chile. This species mainly inhabits mountain habitats and is distributed latitudinally along the western slope of the Andes Range. These habitats undergo great temperature fluctuations, exerting pressure on the amphibian. To identify the physiological strategies and thermal behavior of this species, we analyzed the temperature variables CTmin, CTmax, TTR, τheat, and τcool in individuals of three sites from a latitudinal gradient (22°S to 37°S). The amphibians were acclimated to 10 °C and 20 °C and fed ad libitum. The results indicate that the species has a high thermal tolerance range, with a mean of 38.14±1.34 °C, a critical thermal maxima of 34.6–41.4 °C, and a critical thermal minima of 2.6–0.8 °C, classifying the species as eurythermic. Furthermore, there were significant differences in CTmáx and TTR only in the northern site. The differences in thermal time constants between sites are due to the effects of size and body mass. For example, those from the central site had larger size and greater thermal inertia; therefore, they warmed and cooled in a slower manner. The wide thermal limits determined in R. spinulosa confirm that it is a thermo-generalist species, a characteristic that allows the species to survive in adverse microclimatic conditions. The level of plasticity in critical temperatures seems ecologically relevant and supports the acclimatization of thermal limits as an important factor for ectothermic animals to adapt to climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - We determined if the photoperiod regime affects the thermal biology of the tadpoles of Odontophrynus occidentalis from the Monte desert (Argentina). Variables measured were: selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and thermal critical minimum (CTmin). The tadpoles were acclimated to 15±2°C for 15 days, and they were divided in three experimental groups: 24h light, 24h dark and 12h/12h light/dark. Data indicate that the photoperiod had an important effect upon the thermal biology of the Odontophrynus occidentalis tadpoles. The treatment group exposed to 24h of light showed the highest selected temperature and thermal extremes. We suggest that changes in photoperiod may allow these organisms to anticipate the future changes in their thermal environment, as longer days usually involve higher temperatures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent ~65% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species’ thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species’ body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While CTmax and CTmin had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their CTmax, 25% might be moderately affected and 70% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3C temperature increase. © 2019 von May et al.

T2  - Herpetological Journal
AB  - Physiological tolerance to variable environmental conditions is essential for species to disperse over habitat boundaries and sustain populations in new habitats. In particular, salinity and temperature are one of the major factors determining species’ distributions. The tree frog Buergeria japonica is the most widely distributed amphibian species found in the Ryukyu Archipelago in Japan and Taiwan, and uses a wide range of breeding sites. Such characteristics suggest a high salinity and thermal tolerance in B. japonica tadpoles. We measured the salinity and thermal tolerance of tadpoles from three islands to determine if physiological tolerance could have contributed to the wide dispersal and survival across different environments. The critical salinity of B. japonica was 10–11‰, a value markedly below seawater. We also observed a critical maximum temperature of approximately 40°C, a value which is higher than what is commonly observed for other anuran species. This high thermal tolerance may have favoured island dispersal and survival, particularly in volcanic islands. © 2017, British Herpetological Society. All rights reserved.

The thermal tolerance was significantly lowered by all chemicals and concentrations tested. Chlorpyrifos and methyl parathion were the most active compounds tested whereas malathion was the least toxic to H regilla tadpoles. Activity was depressed, in comparison to control tadpoles, by the chemicals methyl parathion (100 ppb) and malathion (500 ppb). Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the up-regulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18. °C, constant 28. °C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28. °C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To examine whether different thermal environments have induced a change in thermal characteristics, we have conducted a between-population comparison on broad geographic patterns of preferred body temperature and critical thermal maximum in a giant spiny-frog Paa spinosa. We found a bimodal pattern of preferred body temperature during the day, with high preferred body temperature during the inactive diurnal period and low temperature during the active nocturnal period. There were significant differences among six populations of P. spinosa in preferred body temperatures, which decreased along a south to north gradient. Unlike preferred body temperatures, critical thermal maximum did not differ between frogs from the six localities. Although not all characteristics of thermal physiology in P. spinosa underwent parallel changes between the populations, the shift of preferred body temperatures suggests that the features of thermal physiology in the frog may change along a latitudinal gradient in response to different thermal environments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The current global warming scenario has led to a renewed interest in determining which species are more vulnerable to climate change. Hence, it is important to understand which factors can affect estimates of species vulnerability. We determined the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for six species of North American anuran larvae and measured the environmental temperatures to which they are exposed during their aquatic stage to estimate their warming tolerance (WT; difference between the critical thermal maximum and the macro- and microhabitat maximum environmental temperatures). Our results indicate that these species exhibited CTmax values (37.8–41.7 °C) that were similar to other temperate species and positively correlated only with environmental temperatures measured at the microclimate scale. This indicates that microclimatic variables are better predictors of CTmax variation than macroclimate data. Moreover, most of the CTmax variation found was associated with higher taxonomic levels, indicating that related species may show similar CTmax values due to phylogenetic inertia. Studied species also exhibited high values of WT (10.3–22.6 °C), similar to temperate amphibian species from other bioregions. This indicates that there is a considerable gap between the species’ critical thermal maximum and maximum environmental temperature, whether using datalogger (microclimate) or WorldClim (macroclimate) environmental data. However, WT estimates based on datalogger data were not related to those based on macroclimate environmental data. Finally, variation associated with the type of environmental data used (macro- vs. microclimate) had a profound influence on WT estimates. Hence, our perception of which species are more vulnerable to global warming changes may depend on the scale of the climate data used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ectotherms are vulnerable to climate change, given their dependence on temperature, and amphibians are particularly interesting because of their complex life cycle. Tadpoles may regulate their body temperature by using suitable thermal microhabitats. Thus, their physiological responses are the result of adjustment to the local thermal limits experienced in their ponds. We studied three anuran tadpole species present in Argentina and Chile: Pleurodema thaul and Pleurodema bufoninum that are seasonal and have broad geographic ranges, and Batrachyla taeniata, a geographically restricted species with overwintering tadpoles. Species with restricted distribution are more susceptible to climate change than species with broader distribution that may cope with potential climatic changes in the environments in which they occur. We aim to test whether these species can buffer the potential effects of climate warming. We used ecological niche models and the outcomes of their thermal attributes (critical thermal limits, optimal temperature, and locomotor performance breadth) as empirical evidence of their capacity. We found that Pleurodema species show broader performance curves, related to their occurrence, while the geographically restricted B. taeniata shows a narrower thermal breadth, but is faster in warmer conditions. The modeled distributions and empirical physiological results suggest no severe threats for these three anurans. However, the risk level is increasing and a retraction of their distribution range might be possible for Pleurodema species, and some local population extinctions may happen, particularly for the narrowly distributed B. taeniata. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The Barton Springs Salamander (Eurycea sosorum) is listed federally as endangered and is an obligate aquatic salamander with a substantial population occurring in a few spring outflows located in a highly urbanized recreational area near downtown Austin, Texas, USA. The purpose of this study was to gain essential information regarding the response of E. sosorum to several thermal manipulations. All salamanders used in this study were produced at the San Marcos Aquatic Resources Center (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in San Marcos, Texas, USA, as part of a captive breeding program. To examine the effects of thermal stressors, we subjected salamanders to a nominal temperature increase of 0.5° C per day until we observed a loss of righting response (LRR). Additionally, we assessed salamander growth following a 69-d trial in which we reared young E. sosorum at five temperature treatments (nominal 15, 18, 21, 24 and 27° C). The cumulative ET50 (Effective Temperature at which half of the salamanders experienced a LRR [mean ± SD]) for the combined replicates observed in E. sosorum was 32.6 ± 0.08° C. The optimal temperature for growth of E. sosorum based on weight and total length was estimated to be 18.7° C and 18.3° C, respectively. These results will aid in the conservation, management, and ongoing efforts to culture E. sosorum in captivity. Further, our results may provide insight to the potential thermal tolerances of other perennibranchiate Eurycea salamanders in central Texas thought to be sensitive to thermal fluctuations in their habitats. © 2016.

TI  - Limited capacity for acclimation of thermal physiology in a salamander, Desmognathus brimleyorum

AB  - Habitats vary in temperature both spatially and temporally. Variation in thermal habitat introduces challenges to organisms and may reduce fitness unless organisms can physiologically adjust to such changes. Theory predicts that thermal variability should influence the capacity for acclimation such that increased variation should favor a reduction in the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits. In this study, we investigated acclimation to constant and variable conditions in populations of the salamander Desmognathus brimleyorum from the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We exposed salamanders to constant and variable temperature regimes for 8 weeks in the laboratory. We then tested salamanders for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and the thermal sensitivities of swimming performance and standard metabolic rate. Our results indicate limited capacity for thermal acclimation to constant and variable conditions in D. brimleyorum. Instead, variation in physiological traits is dominated by differences among populations. Population differences do not appear to be correlated with observed variation in the thermal conditions of the streams, but are likely a consequence of structural and ecological differences. Due to the mixed support for theoretical predictions for acclimation to alternative environments, further consideration should be given to revising and expanding current theoretical models. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We studied the thermal tolerances of Odontophrynus occidentalis during the dry and wet seasons of the Monte Desert in San Juan Province, Argentina. This toad had differences in CTmax between dry and wet seasons, with CTmax values being greater in the wet season (Austral summer). Operative temperature, body temperature, and environmental maximal temperature were related to CTmax suggesting seasonal acclimatization in O. occidentalis. Additionally, the CTmax recorded for O. occidentalis was 36.1 °C, and the maximum ambient temperature measured during the toads activity time was 37 °C. The CTmin of O. occidentalis was 4.1 °C while the minimum environmental temperature recorded was 7.2 °C. The wide tolerance range observed and the relationship between tolerance limits and the environmental extremes indicate that seasonal acclimatization is an effective mechanism by which toads can raise their thermal tolerance. This is a highly relevant adaptation allowing them to survive in the challenging conditions of the Monte Desert.

Plethodon jordani had substantial amounts of heat shock protein (hsp) 70 present in its tissues when acclimated to 15°C (LD 12:12). 3. The increase in hsp 70 in P. jordani (13.2%) after heat shock at 2°C below its critical thermal maximum (CTMax) (34.1 °C) was not statistically significantly higher than the control value. 4. An immunoblot with monoclonal antibody after 2-D SDS PAGE gel indicated that constitutive hsp 70 was the major form of hsp 70 in P. jordani.

AB  - Predicting the effects of high environmental temperatures and drought on populations requires understanding how these conditions will influence the thermoregulatory behavior and thermal tolerance of organisms. Ectotherms show proportional (fine-tuned) and all-or-none (abrupt) responses to avoid overheating. Scattered evidence suggests that dehydration alters these behavioral responses and thermal tolerance, but these effects have not been evaluated in an integrative manner. We examined the effects of hydration level on the behavioral thermoregulation and behavioral and physiological thermal limits of the “bullfrog” (Rana catesbeiana), a well-studied and important invasive species. To examine the effects of dehydration on proportional responses, we compared the Preferred Body Temperatures (PBT) of frogs with restricted and unrestricted access to water. To assess the effect of dehydration on all-or-none responses, we measured and compared the Voluntary Thermal Maximum (VTMax) at different hydration levels (100%, 90%, 80% of body weight at complete hydration). Finally, to understand the effect of dehydration on physiological thermal tolerance, we measured the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) of frogs at matched hydration levels. PBT, VTMax, and CTMax all decreased in response to higher dehydration levels. However, bullfrogs changed their PBT more than their VTMax or CTMax in response to dehydration. Moreover, some severely dehydrated individuals did not exhibit a VTMax response. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of plasticity of thermoregulatory responses and thermal limits, and its potential application to mechanistic modeling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental variation induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten species by causing environmental stress. Anuran larvae experiencing environmental stress may display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits. Therefore, any capacity to adapt to environmental changes through plastic responses provides a key to determining species vulnerability to environmental variation. We investigated whether developmental temperature (Tdev), altered TH levels and whether the interactive effect of both affect standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), survival and thermal tolerance in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) reared at five temperatures with experimentally altered TH levels. At metamorphosis, SMR, BC and survival were significantly affected by Tdev, TH status and their interaction with the latter often intensified impacts. Larvae developing at warmer temperatures exhibited significantly higher SMRs and BC was reduced at warm Tdev and high TH levels suggesting decreased ability to acclimate to variation in temperature. Accordingly, tadpoles that developed at warm temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but more narrow thermal tolerance windows. High and low TH levels decreased and increased upper thermal limits, respectively. Thus, when experiencing both warmer temperatures and environmental stress, larvae may be less able to compensate for changes in Tdev. Our results demonstrate that physiological traits in larvae of X. laevis are strongly affected by increased TH levels and warmer temperatures. Altered TH levels and increasing Tdev due to global change may result in a reduced capacity for physiological plasticity. This has far reaching consequences since the energetic requirement at the onset of metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © The Author(s) 2018.

AU  - Reichenbach, N.

T2  - Herpetological Bulletin
AB  - The Peaks of Otter salamander, Plethodon hubrichti, is a montane species found at elevations above 442 m within a 117 km2 area of the Blue Ridge Mountains in central Virginia, USA. In areas of this species' range where the Eastern Red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus, a potential competitor, is absent, surface-active salamander density was hypothesised to decrease at lower elevations due to increased temperatures and lower humidities, which may adversely affect salamander reproductive output and survival rates. Eggs/female, % gravid females, surface-active salamander density, temperature and relative humidity were recorded from nine sites ranging in elevation from 488 to 1143 m. Survival rates and growth rates were estimated at three of these sites. Surface-active salamander densities, survival rates, growth rates, eggs/female and reproductive output decreased with elevation. Decreases were correlated with increases in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity associated with decline in elevation. Other habitat factors such as % canopy closure did not decrease with elevation at the study sites. Peaks of Otter salamanders had greater dehydration rates and lower critical thermal maxima than the wider-ranging Eastern red-backed salamanders, which reflects their adaptation to montane environments. These results support the importance of conserving mature hardwood forests, particularly at lower elevations, which represent marginal environments for montane species of salamanders. © 2017 The British Herpetological Society.

AB  - We collected six clutches of the Cricket Frog Fejervarya limnocharis and 10 clutches of the Ornate Narrow- mouthed Frog Microhyla ornata in late June 2010 from Fuyang, Zhejiang, East China, and incubated eggs of the two species at a constant temperature of 25 °C. We raised 30 tadpoles from each clutch and released the remaining ones to the site where the clutches were collected. We randomly selected 90 tadpoles from those raised in the laboratory, and acclimated them at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C), 30 individuals at each temperature, for two weeks to examine the influence of thermal acclimation on selected body temperature (Tsel, a measure of thermal preference) and thermal tolerance [critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax)] and viable temperature range (VTR), and whether tadpoles of these two sympatric species differ in thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Tsel was measured by recording the water temperature where the tadpole stayed in a thermal gradient ranging from 15 °Cto 38 °C. We cooled (for CTMin determination) at the rate of 0. 2 °C/ min or heated (for CTMax determination) tadpoles from 25 °Cat the rate of 0. 6 °C/ min. Body temperatures associated with a transient loss of the righting response at the lower and the upper limits of the thermal tolerance were considered to be the endpoints for CTMin and CTMax, respectively. Tadpoles of the two species did not differ in Tsel, and neither in F. limnocharis nor in M. ornata were body temperatures selected by tadpoles affected by thermal acclimatio. CTMim was greater in tadpoles of M. ornata, whereas CTMax and VTR were greater in tadpoles of F. limnocharis. CTMin and CTMax increased as acclimation temperature increased, and VTR decreased as acclimation temperature increased, in both species. Our data show that tadpoles of the two species do not differ in thermal preference but in thermal tolerance, and that thermal acclimation plays an important role in influencing thermal tolerance but not in thermal preference. Temperature is among the most important abiotic factors influencing biological processes in organisms and has consequences on their habitat requirements and hence spatial distribution, and is therefore a part of an organism's multidimensional niche that should be treated as an ecological resource. Theoretically, species cannot coexist without a quantitative partitioning of resources along the axes of diet, space, time and thermal requirement. That sympatric species respond differently to variation in temperature at the spatial scale of the local community by using microhabitats with different thermal regimes may facilitate their coexistence. Our finding that tadpoles of F. limnocharis and M. ornata differ in thermal tolerance may have an implication for their differences in microhabitat use in nature, which may promote the coexistence of these two sympatric frog species.

AB  - Global warming is having impacts across the Tree of Life. Understanding species’ physiological sensitivity to temperature change and how they relate to local temperature variation in their habitats is crucial to determining vulnerability to global warming. We ask how species’ vulnerability varies across habitats and elevations, and how climatically buffered microhabitats can contribute to reduce their vulnerability. We measured thermal sensitivity (critical thermal maximum—CTmax) of 14 species of Pristimantis frogs inhabiting young and old secondary, and primary forests in the Colombian Andes. Exposure to temperature stress was measured by recording temperature in the understorey and across five microhabitats. We determined frogs’ current vulnerability across habitats, elevations and microhabitats accounting for phylogeny and then ask how vulnerability varies under four warming scenarios: +1.5, +2, +3 and +5°C. We found that CTmax was constant across species regardless of habitat and elevation. However, species in young secondary forests are expected to become more vulnerable because of increased exposure to higher temperatures. Microhabitat variation could enable species to persist within their thermal temperature range as long as regional temperatures do not surpass +2°C. The effectiveness of microhabitat buffering decreases with a 2–3°C increase, and is almost null under a 5°C temperature increase. Microhabitats will provide thermal protection to Andean frog communities from climate change by enabling tracking of suitable climates through short distance movement. Conservation strategies, such as managing landscapes by preserving primary forests and allowing regrowth and reconnection of secondary forest would offer thermally buffered microhabitats and aid in the survival of this group. © 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Environmental stress induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten the productivity of species and persistence of populations. Ectotherms can potentially cope with stressful conditions such as extremes in temperature by exhibiting physiological plasticity. Amphibian larvae experiencing stressful environments display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits and acclimation capacity. We investigated how developmental temperature (Tdev) and altered TH levels (simulating proximate effects of environmental stress) influence the standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), and thermal tolerance in metamorphic and post-metamorphic anuran larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria) reared at five constant temperatures (14–28 °C). At metamorphosis, larvae that developed at higher temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but narrower ranges in thermal tolerance. Mean CTmax was 37.63 °C ± 0.14 (low TH), 36.49 °C ± 0.31 (control), and 36.43 °C ± 0.68 (high TH) in larvae acclimated to different temperatures. Larvae were able to acclimate to higher Tdev by adjusting their thermal tolerance, but not their SMR, and this effect was not impaired by altered TH levels. BC was reduced by 80% (metamorphic) and by 85% (post-metamorphic) at highest Tdev. The effect of stressful larval conditions (i.e., different developmental temperatures and, to some extent, altered TH levels) on SMR and particularly on BC at the onset of metamorphosis was carried over to froglets at the end of metamorphic climax. This has far reaching consequences, since body condition at metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and, thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biological and methodological factors influence the upper thermal limits (UTL) of ectothermic animals, but most factors have been studied independently. Few studies have integrated variables, so our understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary. Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols (heating rates, ΔTs) and biological factors (ontogeny and body mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal Maximum (CT max ). The species displayed slightly different responses to ΔTs: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CT max increased at a fastest ΔT, the same response happened in P. nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate ΔTs. Also, the CT max of P. nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of ΔT, but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat tolerance at the slow ΔT. Finally, we detected small, synergic effects of body mass and ΔTs on the CT max of both species. In small B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass had a positive effect on CT max , but only at slow and moderate ΔTs, probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast ΔT, but this result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is related to acute temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Amphibians are considered one of the groups most susceptible to chemical contamination, therefore are good bio-indicators of aquatic pollution. Synergistic effects of temperature and pesticides have been found in amphibians determining amplified toxicity effect on survival and malformations with increasing temperatures. We studied the sensitivity of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles over on two fitness related thermal traits: locomotor swimming performance and thermal tolerance limits (CTmax = critical thermal maximum and CTmin = critical thermal minimum). Our result shows a decrease in the locomotor performance of R. arenarum tadpoles with increasing sublethal chlorpyrifos concentrations. The experimental temperature increased locomotor performance but this being only significant for the control whereas tadpoles raised at any sublethal chlorpyrifos concentration did not increase their total swimming distance with temperature (Concentration × Temperature interaction, P &lt; 0.019). Chlorpyrifos toxicity decreases maximum swimming distance but this reduction not compensated at high temperatures that do enhance swimming performance in the control treatment. On the other hand, higher chlorpyrifos sensitivity in CTmax than CTmin since tadpoles exposed to all polluted treatments exhibits a significant decline in CTmax but not in CTmin. Current global warming and the increase of atypical climatic events, such as heat waves may put at risk the larval chlorpyrifos polluted populations of R. arenarum. Our results show that the sublethal concentrations of the chlorpyrifos pesticide may affect the fitness and survival of the larvae of R. arenarum. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global climate change will have a greater impact on ectotherms in tropical and subtropical communities than at higher latitudes, because ambient temperatures are closer to the upper thermal limits of species. Amphibian species are highly dependent on external weather conditions, and the effect of global warming on these has been evaluated recently. The Great Chilean frog (Calyptocephalella gayi) is an endemic, monotypic species and genus whose conservation status is considered Vulnerable because of high extraction pressure for human consumption, lack of regulatory measures and comprehension by its consumers. Their populations have also declined due to the loss and destruction of their habitats. C. gayi has not been considered as an object of physiological study, so this large species is not known as one that can adapt to current environmental changes. In this study we analyze the thermoregulatory capacity and thermal efficiency of C. gayi to determine its potential for climatic adaptation. The results indicate that this species is strictly a thermal-conformer; its thermal efficiency and its ability to withstand high temperatures allow it to sustain itself under a climate change scenario, however, it has thermal constraints that do not allow it to withstand temperatures greater than 30 °C. By modeling its ontogenetic conditions mathematically, we project that the larvae are not in danger, although there is a group of around 4% which is very close to 30 °C, which is the highest temperature recorded for the species. However, about 40% of subadults and approximately 47% of adult frogs will not survive the change of ~7 °C projected for the following 85 years, which will affect future generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We studied a combination of thermal parameters (critical thermal maximum, selected body temperature, and field body temperature) and locomotor performance capacities (laboratory and field conditions) of juveniles of Pleurodema nebulosum. We found that field body temperature was determined largely by the temperature of the micro-environment. Field body temperatures of juveniles of P. nebulosum were below selected body temperature. The locomotor performance curve was maximized and reaches a plateau between 30 and 35°C, with 35°C being the temperature at which maximum performance was obtained for analyzed individuals. The plateau values were close to the selected body temperature (Tsel) obtained for the studied frogs. In field conditions the locomotor performance was determinated by the substrate temperature. Apparently, juveniles of P. nebulosum show thermal coadaptation because the selected body temperature and the optimum temperature for locomotion had close values. We believe that the temperatures prevailing during the early hours of activity would allow frogs to explore the micro-environment, covering larger areas in search of food. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Body temperature is the most important physiological variable affecting the performance of ectothermic animals. In June and October of 2011, we collected female and male subadults (gonads have not yet matured), juveniles (tails have just been completely absorbed), and tadpoles (stages 28-38) of the tiger frog Hoplobatrachus chinensis, which is a national secondary grade protection animal, from the herpetological laboratory of Lishui University, Zhejiang, East China. The objectives of this study were to examine ontogenetic shifts in the selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of the tiger frog. Tsel of tadpoles was measured by recording the water temperature of their selected location in a thermal gradient ranging from 10-42°C, while Tsel of juveniles and subadults was measured by recording cloacal temperature in a thermal gradient ranging from 20-45°C. We cooled (for CTmin determination) or heated (for CTmax determination) experimental animals from 25°C. Body temperatures associated with a transient loss of the righting response at lower and upper limits of thermal tolerance were considered to be the endpoints for CTmin and CTmax, respectively. Statistical analysis by ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in Tsel, CTmin, CTmax, and viable temperature range among the three age groups. The Tsel of juveniles (24. 10°C) was significantly lower than that of female subadults (28. 06°C), male subadults (29. 17°C), and tadpoles (28. 23°C), while there was no significant difference in Tsel among the latter three groups. The CTmin of juveniles (13. 85°C) was significantly higher than that of female subadults (11. 27°C), male subadults (10. 84 °C), and tadpoles (10. 74 °C), while there was no significant difference in CTmin among the latter three. Tadpoles had the highest CTmax, which was 43. 31°C, followed by subadults (female: 39. 55°C; male: 39. 02°C) and juveniles in decreasing order. Similarly, tadpoles had the widest viable temperature range (32. 58 °C), followed by subadults (female: 28. 28 °C; male: 28. 18 °C), and juveniles (21. 62°C) in decreasing order. There were no significant differences in Tsel, CTmin, CTmax, and viable temperature range between female and male subadults. Body temperature of juveniles and subadults of H. chinensis was significantly correlated with water temperature in both decreasing and increasing rates. After removing the effects of water temperature, changes in rates of body temperature variation were removed by using residuals from the regression. Two-way ANOVA (cooling and heating rate were measured repeatedly) indicated that the rates of change in the body temperature of juveniles were significantly greater than rates of change of subadults. Types of thermal changes (i. e. rates of cooling and heating) and the interaction of these factors had no effect on changes in the body temperature of H. chinensis. In conclusion, we suggest that in the tiger frog H. chinensis, fundamental thermal niche separation and development restrictions are the most probable explanations for our findings.

AB  - The conversion of natural habitats to human land uses often increases local temperatures, creating novel thermal environments for species. The variable responses of ectotherms to habitat conversion, where some species decline while others persist, can partly be explained by variation among species in their thermal niches. However, few studies have examined thermal niche variation within species and across forest-land use ecotones, information that could provide clues about the capacity of species to adapt to changing temperatures. Here, we quantify individual-level variation in thermal traits of the tropical poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in thermally contrasting habitats. Specifically, we examined local environmental temperatures, field body temperatures (Tb), preferred body temperatures (Tpref), critical thermal maxima (CTmax), and thermal safety margins (TSM) of individuals from warm, converted habitats and cool forests. We found that frogs from converted habitats exhibited greater mean Tb and Tpref than those from forests. In contrast, CTmax and TSM did not differ significantly between habitats. However, CTmax did increase moderately with increasing Tb, suggesting that changes in CTmax may be driven by microscale temperature exposure within habitats rather than by mean habitat conditions. Although O. pumilio exhibited moderate divergence in Tpref, CTmax appears to be less labile between habitats, possibly due to the ability of frogs in converted habitats to maintain their Tb below air temperatures that reach or exceed CTmax. Selective pressures on thermal tolerances may increase, however, with the loss of buffering microhabitats and increased frequency of extreme temperatures expected under future habitat degradation and climate warming.

AB  - The developmental environment has significant immediate effects on phenotypes, but it may also persistently or permanently shape phenotypes across life history. This study examined how developmental temperature influenced embryonic and larval phenotypes of Baja California chorus frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca), an abundant amphibian in southern California and northern Baja California. We collected egg clutches from native ponds in northern San Diego County within 24 h of fertilization, and clutches were separated and distributed between constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, and 25°C for incubation. Oxygen consumption rate (V.O2), developmental stage, and embryo and yolk masses were measured throughout development. Time to 50% hatch, survival at 50% hatch, and hatch duration were determined. Development rate was strongly affected by temperature, with warmer temperatures reducing time to hatch and hatch duration. Survival to hatch was high across all temperatures, 90% Mass-specific V.O2of embryos either remained constant or increased throughout development, and by hatching energy demand was significantly increased at higher temperatures. There were limited temperature effects on growth, with embryo and yolk dry mass similar between temperatures throughout embryonic development. To examine long-Term effects of embryonic temperature, we reared hatchlings from each temperature until onset of larval feeding. Once feeding, larvae were acclimated to 20 or 25°C (2 weeks). Following acclimation to 20 or 25°C, we measured larval mass-specific V.O2 and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) at a common developmental stage (Gosner stages 32-36, "hindlimb toe differentiation"). Embryonic temperature had persistent effects on larval V.O2and CTMax, with warmer temperatures generally resulting in similar or higher V.O2 and CTMax. This partially supported a "warmer is better" effect of embryonic incubation temperature. These results suggest that in a thermally robust amphibian species, temperature may program the phenotype during early development to construct traits in thermal tolerance and energy use that may persist. Overall, P. hypochondriaca displays a thermally robust phenotype, and it is possible that amphibians that possess a wider range of phenotypic plasticity will be relatively more successful mitigating effects of climate change. © 2019 Mueller, Bucsky, Korito and Manzanares.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is distributed from Peru to Argentina (from 1200 to 5000 m elevation), inhabiting arid mountain valleys of the Andes, characterized by salty soils. The variations in soil salinity, caused by high evapotranspiration of water, can create an osmotic constraint and high thermal oscillations for metamorphsed Andean toad (R. spinulosa), affecting their thermoregulation and extreme thermal tolerances. We investigated the changes in thermal tolerance parameters (critical thermal maximum and crystallization temperature) of a population of metamorphosed R. spinulosa from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina, under different substrate salinity conditions. Our results suggest that the locomotor performance of metamorphs of R. spinulosa is affected by increasing salinity concentrations in the environment where they develop. On the other hand, the thermal extremes of metamorphs of R. spinulosa also showed changes associated with different salinity conditions. According to other studies on different organisms, the increase of the osmolarity of the internal medium may increase the thermal tolerance of this species. More studies are needed to understand the thermo-osmolar adjustments of the metamorphs of toads to environmental variability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal acclimatory adjustments of locomotor performance and thermal tolerance occur commonly in ectothermic animals. However, few studies have investigated ontogenetic differences in these acclimatory responses, and thus, their causes remain unclear. In this study, juvenile and adult Chinese fire-bellied newts (Cynops orientalis) were acclimated to one of two temperatures (16 or 24 °C) for 4 weeks to examine ontogenetic differences in acclimation effect on burst swimming speed, and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax). Swimming performance was thermally acclimated in both juvenile and adult C. orientalis. Adult newts had greater absolute swimming speeds than juveniles, which may simply result from their larger sizes. Cold acclimation enhanced low-temperature resistance, and warm acclimation enhanced high-temperature resistance in both juveniles and adults. Despite no ontogenetic difference in CTMin, adult newts had greater CTMax and acclimation response ratio than juveniles, indicating their greater abilities to withstand extreme high temperatures and manage rapid temperature shifts. Ontogenetic change in the thermal acclimatory responses of newts may be related to changes in the thermal environment they experience. © Firenze University Press.

AB  - The Japanese stream tree frog, Buergeria japonica, is widely distributed across the southern islands of Japan and Taiwan. While the species is known to inhabit hot springs, this has only been reported in Taiwan. To further understand the utilization of hot springs by B. japonica, we conducted field observations of tadpoles from a hot spring on Kuchinoshima Island, a tiny volcanic island of southwestern Japan. We found that tadpoles on Kuchinoshima Island inhabited hot spring pools with extremely high temperatures that exceeded temperatures in which any other amphibians have been found. In addition, we conducted thermal tolerance measurements and found that the thermal tolerance of B. japonica tadpoles was high. These findings suggest that high thermal tolerance of B. japonica is maintained even at the northern tip of its distribution, and this has allowed them to widen their available niche and inhabit a hot spring on the tiny island of Kuchinoshima. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.

AB  - Xenopus tropicalis has many advantages as a next-generation model animal for biological research. However, the temperature tolerance range of this frog is narrow, making transportation of live specimens difficult under extreme air temperatures in the summer and winter. This seasonal constraint diminishes the usefulness of X. tropicalis as an experimental animal, so an improved transportation method is required. To overcome this challenge, we conducted: (1) survival experiments under extreme temperature conditions; (2) tests of thermal retention abilities of a unique transport container system; and (3) actual transport experiments. Survival experiments indicated that 14-31C was a safe temperature range for 48-h survival of adult X. tropicalis (48 hours corresponds to the standard domestic transport time expected for delivery service companies in Japan). The container system built here was able to maintain safe temperatures over 72 h when outside temperatures were extreme, and it worked better in combination with a plastic box frog cage. The effectiveness of the transport container was demonstrated by actual transport experiments performed during the summer and winter. The survival rates of the frogs were 100% with the container system. Because the transport container can maintain mild temperatures internally over 72 h, this container system can be used to transport many different temperature-sensitive organisms. © 2014 by The Herpetological Society of Japan.

AB  - 1. 1. Various blood constituents were measured in an attempt to identify the effects of exposure of Great Plains toads to the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and determine the time course of the onset of and recovery from these effects. 2. 2. Tests for generalized tissue damage inclucling serum glutamic-oxalacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were unaffected by acute thermal stress. 3. 3. Hematocrit, erythrocyte number, mean cell volume and hemoglobin concentration were also unchanged. 4. 4. Blood glucose, lactic acid and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels all increased significantly. 5. 5. Blood pH, PO2 and HCO3- also increased with acute heat stress while PCO2 decreased. 6. 6. Long-term exposure to temperatures near the CTmax may cause severe tissue damage. Acute thermal stress does not appear to cause damage other than the short-term, reversible effects of strong physical exercise. © 1987.

AB  - The vulnerability of species to climate change is jointly influenced by geographic phenotypic variation, acclimation and behavioural thermoregulation. The importance of interactions between these factors, however, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate how advances in mechanistic niche modelling can be used to integrate and assess the influence of these sources of uncertainty in forecasts of climate change impacts. We explored geographic variation in thermal tolerance (i.e. maximum and minimum thermal limits) and its potential for acclimation in juvenile European common frogs Rana temporaria along elevational gradients. Furthermore, we employed a mechanistic niche model (NicheMapR) to assess the relative contributions of phenotypic variation, acclimation and thermoregulation in determining the impacts of climate change on thermal safety margins and activity windows. Our analyses revealed that high-elevation populations had slightly wider tolerance ranges driven by increases in heat tolerance but lower potential for acclimation. Plausibly, wider thermal fluctuations at high elevations favour more tolerant but less plastic phenotypes, thus reducing the risk of encountering stressful temperatures during unpredictable extreme events. Biophysical models of thermal exposure indicated that observed phenotypic and plastic differences provide limited protection from changing climates. Indeed, the risk of reaching body temperatures beyond the species' thermal tolerance range was similar across elevations. In contrast, the ability to seek cooler retreat sites through behavioural adjustments played an essential role in buffering populations from thermal extremes predicted under climate change. Predicted climate change also altered current activity windows, but high-elevation populations were predicted to remain more temporally constrained than lowland populations. Our results demonstrate that elevational variation in thermal tolerances and acclimation capacity might be insufficient to buffer temperate amphibians from predicted climate change; instead, behavioural thermoregulation may be the only effective mechanism to avoid thermal stress under future climates. © 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Captive-bred organisms are widely used in ecology, evolution and conservation research, especially in scenarios where natural populations are scarce or at risk of extinction. Yet, it is still unclear whether captivity may alter thermal tolerances, crucial traits to predict species resilience to global warming. Here, we study whether captive-bred tadpoles of the gliding treefrog (Agalychnis spurrelli) show different thermal tolerances than wild-caught individuals. Our results show that there are no differences between critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) of captive-bred and wild-caught tadpoles exposed to three-day acclimatization at 20 °C. Therefore, we suggest that the use of captive-bred amphibians is valid and may be appropriate in experimental comparisons to thermal physiological studies of wild populations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Short-legged, small, robust frogs of the family Craugastoridae present a remarkable beta-diversity in the high Andes, their distributions being characterized by a very high degree of micro-endemism to specific valleys. We used dataloggers to study the temperature and humidity conditions of microhabitats of several species of the genus Microkayla at three elevation belts: Below, within, and above the altitudinal range of their distribution in Bolivia. We also conducted thermal physiology experiments on a limited number of individuals of one of these species. Our aim was to infer on factors that may limit the distribution of anurans in a biological hotspot that is threatened by climate warming. We found an unexpected thermal heterogeneity within the slopes at three different Andean valleys that explained the specific distribution of species of Microkayla at each site. Species distribution was associated to elevation belts with the highest ambient relative humidity, and there was high variability in thermal preference when individuals were experimentally exposed to a thermal gradient. Critical thermal maxima compared to the temperatures that frogs confront in nature, as well as thermal performance trials, revealed that the studied species has a broad physiological tolerance to temperature. These results point to moisture, and not temperature, as the limiting climatic factor determining the occurrence of these species in high Andean slopes, but further experimental work on water balance is needed. The predicted desertification of the Andes in future climate change scenarios poses a potentially serious threat to this highly diverse group of amphibians. © 2020 Brazilian Society of Herpetology.

AB  - Environmental temperature has fitness consequences on ectotherm development, ecology and behaviour. Amphibians are especially vulnerable because thermoregulation often trades with appropriate water balance. Although substantial research has evaluated the effect of temperature in amphibian locomotion and physiological limits, there is little information about amphibians living under extreme temperature conditions. Leptodactylus lithonaetes is a frog allegedly specialised to forage and breed on dark granitic outcrops and associated puddles, which reach environmental temperatures well above 40 ˚C. Adults can select thermally favourable microhabitats during the day while tadpoles are constrained to rock puddles and associated temperature fluctuations; we thus established microhabitat temperatures and tested whether the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of L. lithonaetes is higher in tadpoles compared to adults. In addition, we evaluated the effect of water temperature on locomotor performance of tadpoles. Contrary to our expectations, puddle temperatures were comparable and even lower than those temperatures measured in the microhabitats used by adults in the daytime. Nonetheless, the CTmax was 42.3 ˚C for tadpoles and 39.7 ˚C for adults. Regarding locomotor performance, maximum speed and maximum distance travelled by tadpoles peaked around 34 ˚C, approximately 1 ˚C below the maximum puddle temperatures registered in the puddles. In conclusion, L. lithonaetes tadpoles have a higher CTmax compared to adults, suggesting a longer exposure to extreme temperatures that lead to maintain their physiological performance at high temperatures. We suggest that these conditions are adaptations to face the strong selection forces driven by this granitic habitat. © 2019, British Herpetological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change and infectious disease by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are major drivers of amphibian extinctions, but the potential interactions of these two factors are not fully understood. Temperature is known to influence (1) the infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence of Bd; (2) host-parasite dynamics, especially when both hosts and parasites are ectothermic organisms exhibiting thermal sensitivities that may or may not differ; and (3) amphibian vulnerability to extinction depending on their heat tolerance, which may decrease with infection. Thus, in a global warming scenario, with rising temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, amphibians infected by Bd could be expected to be more vulnerable if temperatures approach their critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, it is also possible that predicted high temperatures could clear the Bd infection, thus enhancing amphibian survival. We tested these hypotheses by measuring CTmax values of Bd-infected and Bd-free aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial toadlets/juveniles of the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) and examining whether exposure of A. obstetricans individuals to peak temperatures reaching their CTmax clears them from Bd infection. We show that (1) Bd has a wide thermal tolerance range; (2) Bd is capable of altering the thermal physiology of A. obstetricans, which is stage-dependent, lowering CTmax in tadpoles but not in toadlets; and (3) Bd infection is not cleared after exposure of tadpoles or toadlets to CTmax. Living under climatic change with rising temperatures, the effect of Bd infection might tip the balance and lead some already threatened amphibian communities towards extinction. © 2019 Fernández-Loras et al.

AB  - Environmental temperature variation generates adaptive phenotypic differentiation in widespread populations. We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (~2000 m above sea level) and low (~ 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (Topt) had a >9°C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0°C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5°C; cross-bred, 25.9°C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8±0.8°C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins and all crossbred tadpoles (37.0±0.8 and 37.1±0.8°C). Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins and all cross-bred tadpoles had higher CTmin (4.2±0.7 and 4.2±0.7°C) than pure-bred tadpoles with highaltitude parental origins (2.5±0.6°C). Our study shows that the varying thermal physiological traits of Xenopus laevis tadpoles are the result of adaptive responses to their parental thermal environments. This study is one of few demonstrating potential intraspecific evolution of critical thermal limits in a vertebrate species. Multi-generation common garden experiments and genetic analyses would be required to further tease apart the relative contribution of plastic and genetic effects to the adaptive phenotypic variation observed in these tadpoles. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Organisms with complex ecologies and life-cycle processes may shift physiologically (acclimation in tolerance), developmentally, and/or behaviorally (thermoregulation) in response to changes in climate. As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10% increase in tolerance limits per 1 °C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits. Our study highlights the idiosyncrasies of estimating climate vulnerability, where multiple phenotypes can respond to shifts in temperature—a complexity that is especially apparent in species with complex life-cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current assessments of organismal vulnerability to global warming are focusing on physiological trait-based indices that may allow biologically sounding estimates of heating risk at the local scale. However, intraspecific variability in both exposure and physiological performance may determine large heterogeneity in the distribution of heating risks through the overall species range compromising whole species risk assessments. We examine intra- and interspecific variability in two vulnerability indexes: warming tolerances (WT), or the extent that maximum temperatures (T max) reaching upper thermal tolerances (CTmax); and thermal safety margin (TSM), or the magnitude that average environmental temperatures (T mean) exceeding the selected or preferred temperatures (T sel), in a subtropical warm amphibian tadpole community, at the Monte Desert ecoregion, Argentina. Tadpole populations breeds in temporary ponds and permanent streams that exhibit high thermal heterogeneity. Those populations and species living in hot water bodies, although exhibiting higher CTmax, have lower WT and are more prone to suffer acute heat impacts, thus confirming the prediction of higher thermal risk in ectotherms exposed to higher temperatures. However, these hot pond breeders, although living closer to their CTmax, also preferred high temperatures, showing higher TSMs and being actually exposed to a lower proportion of stressful temperatures than cool selecting populations. Both WT and TSM indexes have significant interpopulational variation. Thus, our findings suggest that attempts to build mechanistic models to forecast species vulnerability to heat stress due to climate change have to include physiological variation among populations. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - Communities usually possess a multitude of interconnected trophic interactions within food webs. Their regulation generally depends on a balance between bottom-up and top-down effects. However, if sensitivity to temperature varies among species, rising temperatures may change trophic interactions via direct and indirect effects. We examined the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 19 species from temperate wetlands (insect predators, amphibian larvae, zooplankton and amphipods) and determined if they vary in their sensitivity to warming temperatures. CTmax differed between the groups, with predatory insects having higher CTmax than amphibians (both herbivorous larval anurans and predatory larval salamanders), amphipods and zooplankton. In a scenario of global warming, these differences in thermal tolerance may affect top-down and bottom-up processes, particularly considering that insect predators are more likely to maintain or improve their performance at higher temperatures, which could lead to increased predation rates on the herbivores in the food web. Further studies are needed to understand how the energy flows through communities, how species’ energy budgets may change and whether other physiological and behavioral responses (such as phenotypic plasticity and thermoregulation) can buffer or increase these changes in the top-down regulation of wetland food webs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hybridization between native and non-native species is an ongoing global conservation threat. Hybrids that exhibit traits and tolerances that surpass parental values are of particular concern, given their potential to outperform native species. Effective management of hybrid populations requires an understanding of both physiological performance and the underlying mechanisms that drive transgressive hybrid traits. Here, we explore several aspects of the hybridization between the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense; CTS) and the introduced barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium; BTS). We assayed critical thermal maximum (CTMax) to compare the ability of CTS, BTS and F1 hybrids to tolerate acute thermal stress, and found that hybrids exhibit a wide range of CTMax values, with 33% (4/12) able to tolerate temperatures greater than either parent. We then quantified the genomic response, measured at the RNA transcript level, of each salamander, to explore the mechanisms underlying thermal tolerance strategies. We found that CTS and BTS have strikingly different values and tissue-specific patterns of overall gene expression, with hybrids expressing intermediate values. F1 hybrids display abundant and variable degrees of allele-specific expression (ASE), likely arising from extensive compensatory evolution in gene regulatory mechanisms between CTS and BTS. We found evidence that the proportion of genes with allelic imbalance in individual hybrids correlates with their CTMax, suggesting a link between ASE and expanded thermal tolerance that may contribute to the success of hybrid salamanders in California. Future climate change may further complicate management of CTS if hybrid salamanders are better equipped to deal with rising temperatures. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Tropical ectotherm species tend to have narrower physiological limits than species from temperate areas. As a consequence, tropical species are considered highly vulnerable to climate change since minor temperature increases can push them beyond their physiological thermal tolerance. Differences in physiological tolerances can also be seen at finer evolutionary scales, such as among populations of ectotherm species along elevation gradients, highlighting the physiological sensitivity of such organisms. Here, we analyze the influence of elevation and bioclimatic domains, defined by temperature and precipitation, on thermal sensitivities of a terrestrial direct-developing frog (Craugastor loki) in a tropical gradient. We address the following questions: (a) Does preferred temperature vary with elevation and among bioclimatic domains? (b) Do thermal tolerance limits, that is, critical thermal maximum and critical thermal minimum vary with elevation and bioclimatic domains? and (c) Are populations from high elevations more vulnerable to climate warming? We found that along an elevation gradient body temperature decreases as environmental temperature increases. The preferred temperature tends to moderately increase with elevation within the sampled bioclimatic domains. Our results indicate that the ideal thermal landscape for this species is located at midelevations, where the thermal accuracy (db) and thermal quality of the environment (de) are suitable. The critical thermal maximum is variable across elevations and among the bioclimatic domains, decreasing as elevation increases. Conversely, the critical thermal minimum is not as variable as the critical thermal maximum. Populations from the lowlands may be more vulnerable to future increases in temperature. We highlight that the critical thermal maximum is related to high temperatures exhibited across the elevation gradient and within each bioclimatic domain; therefore, it is a response to high environmental temperatures. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Temperature plays a key role in the biology of ectotherms, including anurans, which are found at higher elevations in the tropics than anywhere in the temperate zone. High elevation tropical environments are characterized by extreme daily thermal fluctuation including high daily maxima and nightly freezing. Our study investigated the contrasting operative temperatures of the anurans Telmatobius marmoratus and Pleurodema marmoratum in different environmental contexts at the same elevation and biome above 5,200 m. Telmatobius marmoratus avoids extremes of daily temperature fluctuation by utilizing thermally buffered aquatic habitat at all life stages, with minimal operative temperature variation (range: 4.6–8.0°C). Pleurodema marmoratum, in contrast, experienced operative temperatures from −3.5 to 44°C and has one of the widest thermal breadths reported for any tropical frog, from >32°C (critical thermal maximum) to surviving freezing periods of 1 and 6 hr down to −3.0°C. Our findings expand experimental evidence of frost tolerance in amphibians to the widespread Neotropical family Leptodactylidae, the first such evidence of frost tolerance in a tropical amphibian. Our study identifies three strategies (wide thermal tolerance breadth, use of buffered microhabitats, and behavioral thermoregulation), which allow these tropical frogs to withstand the current wide daily thermal fluctuation above 5,000 m.a.s.l. and which may help them adapt to future climatic changes.

AB  - Most of the literature on temperature–organism interactions rely on mean temperature (mostly air), disregarding the real complexity of this variable. There is a growing consensus about the importance of considering the temperature fluctuations as a mechanism improving organism's performance. Tadpoles are small body size ectotherm organisms that behave isothermally with their environment. As such, are good models for studying their thermal biology relative to their immediate environment. We studied six anuran tadpole species in North Patagonia, Alsodes gargola, Hylorina sylvatica, Batrachyla taeniata, Pleurodema thaul, P. bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa, distributed in a West-East altitudinal cline with different environments and thermal conditions. We evaluated the relationship between thermal descriptors at a local scale and the thermal biology patterns of these temperate tadpoles. We estimated thermal tolerance limits and thermal sensitivity of locomotion of each species. The different aquatic environments showed important differences in local thermal conditions, associated with observed differences in the thermal traits in these tadpoles. Species exposed to lower temperature fluctuations and lower environmental mean temperatures showed lower swimming optimal temperatures and narrower thermal tolerance ranges. We found greater variability in the upper than in the lower critical limits in these Patagonian anuran tadpoles. Minimum critical temperatures were close to freezing temperature, possibly in detriment of their tolerance to high temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that these species are adapted to low temperatures. Finally, warming tolerances and predicted thermal safety margins, show that none of the studied species appear to be under thermal stress that may compromise their survival at the present time or in the near future, under a moderate climate change scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An organism's thermal limits provide valuable insights into species distributions and potential climate change impacts. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in particular has been widely used for among-species analyses of thermal tolerances. However, CTmax measurements can depend on important context-dependencies, including acclimation temperature and experimental procedure. We investigated acclimation effects on CTmax in two amphibian species commonly used as laboratory models, Ambystoma mexicanum (Axolotls) and Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frogs), using the standard dynamic method. Both species exhibited an increased CTmax following acclimation to a warm temperature (24°C) relative to cold acclimation (8°C). We also found that warm-temperature acclimation resulted in significant mass losses in both species, possibly reflecting metabolic costs of living at higher temperatures. Our CTmax measurements for A. mexicanum were consistent with CTmax measurements for closely related salamander species, but CTmax measurements for cold-acclimated X. laevis were inconsistent with a prior study of this species. This might have been because of the earlier study employing a less common curve-fitting method to estimate CTmax. These results highlight the importance of accounting for recent acclimation temperatures when estimating amphibian thermal limits and provide further support for the generalization that most amphibian species exhibit increased CTmax following warm-temperature acclimation. © 2020 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.

AB  - Most predictions of how populations and species of ectotherms will respond to global warming are based on estimates of the temperature at which organisms lose motor control (i.e., CTmax - the Critical Thermal Maximum). Here, we describe a non-lethal protocol and ethograms to estimate the relative tolerance of amphibians to increasing temperatures. These methods—suitable for field or laboratory conditions—are replicable, inexpensive and applicable to both post-metamorphic stages and organisms with direct development. We illustrate the use of this standardized protocol for four amphibians from a tropical cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico with contrasting life histories: a lungless salamander (Aquiloeurycea cafetalera: Plethodontidae), a leaf-litter frog (Craugastor rhodopis: Craugastoridae), a semiaquatic frog (Lithobates berlandieri: Ranidae), and a tree frog (Rheohyla miotympanum: Hylidae). We identified four behavioral responses preceding CTmax for all amphibians included in this study: 1) Optimal Activity Range, 2) Supra-optimal Activity Range, 3) Heat Stress Range, and 4) Involuntary Movements Range. Additionally, we identified a fifth parameter associated with resilience to heat shock: 5) Recovery Stage after reaching CTmax. We conclude that the behavioral responses preceding the Critical Thermal Maximum are as informative as CTmax. Using behavioral responses to estimate thermal tolerance has the additional advantage of reducing the risk of injury or death of amphibians during physiological experiments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Information on the thermal limits and physiology of ectothermic amphibians is crucial to our understanding of their ecology in the natural environment, particularly with predicted global changes in climate. We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0–21.6 °C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Cardiorespiratory studies in tadpols species are scarce, reflecting challenges of using invasive tools, for measuring heart rate (fH) and breathing frequency (fB) by means of implanting electrodes, cannulae, and others, especially in the case of long-term measurements. This study attempted to improve techniques previously used by Longhini and coworkers (2017) on measuring cardiorespiratory parameters non-invasively in bullfrog tadpoles in a much smaller anuran tadpole specie, Boana albopunctaca (Anura: Hylidae) from the Savannah-like Cerrado. This specie occurs in the central, southern and southeastern regions of Brazil in an area where deforestation levels are high. Objective: To determine the resting values for fH and fB of tadpoles (stage 26 from Gosner, 1960) B. albopunctata at 25°C using a non-invasive methodology. Additionally, we determined the Maximum Critical Temperature (CTmax) by exposing tadpoles to a heating ramp (1°C/4min). Material and Methods: Pre-metamorphic tadpoles (N=11) of Boana albopunctata were collected (SISBIO: 621361) in the Cerrado biome, in Minas Gerais state (20º 14' 43" S; 46º 21' 57" O), and maintained in the lab in aquariums at 25°C. The cardiorespiratory parameters, fH and fB, were obtained by a non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) and surface electromyogram (EMG) method, respectively. After baseline measurement, animals were handled in order to administer an intraperitoneal injection of Ringer solution (vehicle) to verify the influence of the injections on the basal cardiorespiratory parameters, which were recorded for an additional hour. For that, we used a thin dental needle (30 gauge) connected by a polyethylene tube (PE10, Clay Adams) to a Hamilton syringe (5 μl). The CTmax, the temperature at which animals lose the ability to escape from conditions that may ultimately lead to death, was determined by exposing tadpoles acclimatized at two different temperatures (15 and 25°C) to a constant heating rate of 1°C/4min. When the animals began to present loss of equilibrium, we stimulated them with a glass rod, and considered the CTmax when tadpoles were motionless after five consecutive taps. Immediately after assessing CTmax, we transferred tadpoles to plastic cups with water at ambient temperature (25°C). We validated the CTmax for individuals that remained alive for at least 24 h after the test. The data obtained were expressed as mean ± s. e. m. Results: At 25°C, baseline values for fH and fB were 104.6 ± 20.0 and 85.94 ± 18.9, respectively. Cardiorespiratory parameters were not significantly affected by the intraperitoneal Ringer solution injection: fH (beats.min−1): 103.2 ± 15.6 and fB (movements.min−1): 85.3 ± 16.1. Animals’ acclimatized at 20°C exhibited CTmax of 35.88 ± 1.58°C compared to those acclimatized at 30°C, with a CTmax of 39.57 ± 0.49°C. Conclusion: According to our preliminary results, we confirm that the non-invasive methodology adapted for larger tadpoles (e.g Bullfrog; size: ~9 cm) can be improved for measuring cardiorespiratory parameters non-invasively in small tadpoles (size: ~4 cm).After one hour from intraperitoneal ringer injection, fH and fB returned to their baseline values. Furthermore, animals acclimated to the higher temperature (30°C) showed greater thermal tolerance during a heating rate protocol. © 2019, Editorial Ciencias Medicas. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermal acclimatory capacity of a particular species determines its tolerance to environmental changes and affects its survival under future changing climatic conditions. Acclimation effects on physiological traits have been determined in many fish and frog species, but rarely in newts or salamanders. In the present study, we evaluated the physiological acclimatory response of newts. A total of 48 juvenile Chinese fire-belly newts (Cynops orientalis) were collected and acclimated to 15°, 20°, and 25°, which represented the low, intermediate, and high environmental temperatures experienced by C. orientalis during their active period, respectively, over the course of 4 weeks. The locomotor (swimming) performances of individuals were measured at the same three test temperatures in a glass tank (150 cm×10 cm×15 cm) filled with water to a depth of 5 cm, and the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) were determined using a dynamic method. The thermal resistance range (TRR) was calculated as the difference between CTMax and CTMin, and acclimation response ratio (ARR) of CTMin and CTMax was obtained by dividing the tolerance change by the change in acclimation temperature. The results from repeated-measures ANOVA analyses revealed that newt swimming speeds were significantly affected by the acclimation and test temperatures. Despite no statistically significant difference, low and intermediate temperature-acclimated newts had relatively high mean swimming speeds at 15° and 20°, respectively, while the high-temperature-acclimated newts had superior swimming speeds at 25°. Similarly, at 15°, low temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than those acclimated to a high temperature. However, at 20°, intermediate temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than low or high temperature-acclimated individuals, while at 25°, high and intermediate temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than those acclimated to low temperature. Thus, our data supports the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that acclimation to a particular temperature enhances the animal’s performance or fitness at that temperature. Our results also indicate that temperature acclimation shifts the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance in C. orientalis since low temperature-acclimated newts appear to have lower thermal sensitivity levels than those acclimated to high temperature. Both CTMin and CTMax were significantly enhanced at higher acclimation temperatures, suggesting that juvenile newts acclimated to low temperatures are more resistant to low temperatures and less resistant to high temperatures, whereas those acclimated to high temperatures are more resistant to high but less resistant to low temperatures. These results are consistent with previous studies focused on the various ectothermic vertebrate species analyzed to date. The TRR of newts was not affected by acclimation temperature, while the ARR of CTMax (0.26) was higher than that of CTMin (0.09) at acclimation temperatures between 15° and 20°, but lower at acclimation temperatures between 20° and 25° (CTMax:0.16 vs CTMin:0.21). These results are consistent with previous predictions that the magnitude of the change in CTMin or CTMax slowly decreases and ultimately approaches zero as the acclimation temperature gradually reaches its thermal limits. Inter-species differences in thermal physiological response to acclimation in amphibians may be correlated with differences in thermal environments in their natural habitats. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24°C) and DTF treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (∼15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (∼30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.

TI  - Effects of Photoperiod and Starvation on the Temperature Tolerance of Larvae of the Giant Toad, Bufo marinus
AU  - Floyd, Robert B.
T2  - Copeia
AB  - The effect of photoperiod on the heat and cold tolerance of Bufo marinus larvae was greatest under conditions that were potentially lethal. Larvae that were acclimated to high temperatures and long days had a higher critical thermal maximum (CTMax) than those acclimated to short days. Similarly, larvae acclimated to lower temperatures and short days were more tolerant to cold than those acclimated to long days. Larvae responded to periods of starvation in a similar way. At high acclimation temperatures, CTMax was relatively constant while CTMin increased significantly with duration of starvation (became less tolerant), and at low acclimation temperatures, CTMin remained constant and CTMax decreased significantly with starvation. CTMax and CTMin acclimated independently such that tolerance under critical conditions was maximized. The effects of photoperiod and starvation on temperature tolerance were not simple but varied with acclimation temperature.

AB  - Abstract Negative impacts on amphibians have been reported due to contamination by agrochemicals. However, until now, no study has tested the effect of the fungicide mancozeb (MZ) on thermal tolerance and its relationship with the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). MZ is the best-selling broad-spectrum fungicide in the world, which negatively affects non-target organisms. Here, we tested for the first time the effects of MZ on critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and its relationship to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in tadpoles of Physalameus henselii, a colder-adapted species in southernmost of the Neotropical region. A sublethal concentration of 2 mg/L was used. We found that the CTmax of the MZ-treated group was lower than that of the control group. In addition, there was an increase in HSP70 expression in tadpoles exposed to MZ and in tadpoles that underwent heat treatment. However, tadpoles subjected to MZ and heat treatment showed no induced HSP70 protein expression. Our results demonstrated that sublethal doses of the fungicide MZ negatively affected the thermal physiology and heat shock protein expression in tadpoles of P. henselii by inducing an increase in HSP70 concentration and by reducing the critical CTmax supported by tadpoles. It is important to understand the relationship between environmental contamination and physiological thermal limits in our current scenario of high rates of habitat conversion associated with unrestricted use of agrochemicals, as well as the challenging environmental changes induced by global warming.

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Temperature tolerances of Bufo hemiophrys and B. cognatus were examined by exposing specimens to lethal high temperatures. Bufo cognatus was able to tolerate significantly higher temperatures than B. hemiophrys. The results yielded an estimated interspecific difference in upper lethal temperature of 2.34 degree plus or minus 0.41 degree. This different was correlated with the geographic distributions of the two species; i.e., the more southern species, B. cognatus, was able to tolerate higher temperatures. This has been taken to indicate that a physiological specialization has taken place which is adaptive for the two species in the microclimates of their respective habitats.

TI  - Role of Temperature and Water in the Ecology of Lungless Salamanders
AU  - Spotila, James R.
T2  - Ecological Monographs
AB  - Water economy and thermal relations of plethodontid salamanders were studied in the laboratory and in the field. Laboratory measurements included behavioral responses in temperature and relative humidity gradients, rates of dehydration and dehydration at various relative humidities and soil—moisture levels, and determination of critical thermal maxima by rapid controlled heating to a definite endpoint. Salamanders were acclimated to a combination of three temperatures and two photoperiods: 5°C, 16 hr of light alternating with 8 hr of darkness (LD 16:8); 5°C, (LD 8:16); 15°C (LD 16:8); 15°C (LD 8:16); 25°C (LD 16:8); and 25°C (LD 8:16). Three series of experiments were conducted on 20 populations representing 14 species. Critical thermal maximum increased with an increase in acclimation temperature indicating that the salamander's heat resistance was readily altered by its previous thermal history. Salamanders selected a definite range of temperatures and did not merely avoid extremes in the thermal gradient. Thermal preferenda were relatively stable for each species and were not significantly affected by either acclimation temperature or photoperiod. Rate of dehydration was dependent upon body size, drying power of the air, and ambient temperature. Interspecific differences in dehydration rates appeared to be related in part to differences in size. Species composed of small individuals lost weight faster than species made up of large individuals. As the vapor pressure deficit increased the dehydration rate increased. Dehydration was more rapid at higher temperatures. Rehydration rate increased as the percentage of weight loss due to dehydration increased and was more rapid at higher temperatures. Salamanders absorbed water from soil when soil—moisture tension was as high as 2.8 atm at 25°C. All species absorbed water from unsaturated soil at similar rates that were dependent upon soil—moisture content. Salamanders in the humidity gradient responded positively to differences in the moisture content of the air, and all but one species were more than 70% successful in selecting the highest relative humidity available in the gradient. Interspecific differences were apparent, but were not always correlated with habitat preferences. Plethodon glutinosus did not show any specific adaptation in its thermal responses or water relations that would account for its widespread distribution in the eastern United States. Plethodon ouachitae and P. caddoensis apparently have survived in the Ouachita Mountains due to favorable microhabitats and their ability to burrow deep beneath talus—covered slopes during hot and dry summers. Surface activity of P. caddoensis is limited in the summer by hot and dry conditions in its microhabitat.

AB  - Del mismo modo que la temperatura y los efectos del cambo climatico varian con en el espacio y en el tiempo, esta tesis doctoral se centra en conocer la variacion en los limites termicos fisiologicos a diferentes escalas espacio-temporales asi como caracterizar el ambiente termico al que actualmente se encuentran expuestos las poblaciones y especies de anfibios analizadas. Ello nos permitira, en primer lugar, aportar informacion basica para tratar de predecir las consecuencias del calentamiento global, y en segundo lugar, poner a prueba algunas hipotesis macrofisiologicas recientes. Asi, los capitulos 1, 2 y 3 se centran en la variabilidad espacial de los limites de tolerancia termicos en anfibios (a lo largo de gradientes altitudinales y latitudinales). Dado que existe cierta controversia acerca del grado de variacion encontrada entre poblaciones de la misma especie y entre especies distintas, los capitulos 1 y 3 adoptan un enfoque interespecifico mientras que el capitulo 2 se ocupa de analizar la variabilidad intraspecifica encontrada para una serie de poblaciones de Rana temporaria a lo largo de un gradiente climatico altitudinal. Los capitulos 4, 5 y 6 se centran en analizar el cambio en los limites de tolerancia en el tiempo ya sea a traves de procesos de aclimatacion (capitulos 4 y 5) o el cambio en las tolerancias termicas en diferentes estadios de desarrollo (capitulo 6). En el capitulo 1: “Testing the climate variability hypothesis in thermal tolerance limits of tropical and temperate tadpoles”, analizamos la variacion latitudinal en los CTmax/CTmin de 47 sp. de anfibios, durante su etapa larvaria, comparando dos comunidades procedentes de Brasil (Bahia) y la Peninsula Iberica y el Norte de Africa. En este trabajo ponemos a prueba la hipotesis de variabilidad climatica en renacuajos, analizando ademas la relevancia de la informacion termica a escalas micro y macroclimaticas como predictores de estos parametros fundamentales de las curvas de performance de los ectotermos.     En el capitulo 2: “Can breeding phenology and plasticity prevent local adaptation in thermal tolerance?”, estudiamos la variacion altitudinal de los limites de tolerancia termica en once poblaciones de Rana temporaria, al tiempo que caracterizamos su ambiente termico teniendo en cuenta la fenologia de la especie, y discutimos acerca de los aspectos que pueden estar afectando al grado de diferenciacion en las tolerancias termicas mostrado entre las poblaciones, asi como si esta diferenciacion puede responder a procesos de adaptacion local.     En el capitulo 3: “Altitudinal variation of the critical thermal limits in 20 species of tadpoles in the tropical Andes”, realizamos una comparacion altitudinal interespecifica en los limites termicos de 20 especies de anuros andinos , durente su etapa larvaria, y una valoracion preliminar del riesgo de extincion de estas especies, basandonos en las estimas de su tolerancia al calentamiento. Del mismo modo que en el capitulo 1, comprobaremos ademas como la hipotesis de variabilidad climatica puede explicar los resultados obtenidos. La segunda parte de la tesis trata de los efectos sobre las tolerancias termicas de la variacion temporal, mediante cambios en las temperaturas de aclimatacion y el estadio de desarrollo ontogenico:     En el capitulo 4: “Acclimation of critical thermal limits in temperate and tropical tadpoles”, analizamos las supuestas diferencias en el potencial de aclimatacion de anfibios tropicales y templados, sometidos a temperaturas constantes en el laboratorio (hipotesis de Brattstrom, Brattstrom (1968)).     En el capitulo 5: “The effect of constant vs fluctuating acclimation on critical thermal limits in three temperate tadpoles”, comparamos los efectos que la aclimatacion puede tener sobre las tolerancia termica de tres especies de anfibios de la Peninsula Iberica cuando se usan a) unas temperaturas de aclimatacion constantes, o b) simulando unas condiciones similares a las que pueden ocurrir en la naturaleza, mediante el empleo de aclimataciones con temperaturas diarias fluctuantes.     En el capitulo 6: “Ontogenetic shifts in thermal tolerances in temperate anurans. Does metamorphosis impose a thermal constraint that may affect vulnerability to global warming?”, analizamos los cambios que tienen lugar a lo largo del desarrollo ontogenetico (larvas, metamorficos y juveniles) en la tolerancia termica de los individuos de seis especies de anuros procedentes de Marruecos y la Peninsula Iberica.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Anurans living along the Andes cordillera exploit several thermal environments that vary with altitude and latitude. Studies on moderate and high-elevation tropical species suggest co-adaptation between thermal ecology and thermal physiology. Our objective was to test whether this is the case for three Patagonian anuran species. We focused on larval stages and analyzed critical maximum and minimum temperatures granting survivorship. The species studied were Abodes gargola, Pleurodema bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa papillosa. Alsodes gargola lives primarily in high-elevation lakes and montane streams, has long larval development and overwinters. In contrast, tadpoles of P. bufoninum and R. s. papillosa use marshes and lower elevation ponds, and develop in three months. Tadpoles of Abodes gargola tolerated experimental temperatures up to 32°C and those of the other two species lost the ability to move at temperatures near 38°C. Tadpoles of all species tolerated experimental exposure to 0°C for a...

AB  - Survival times of anuran tadpoles representing four species of two genera in the families Hylidae and Pelobatidae were determined at high temperatures. Heat resistance was studied by acclimating tadpoles to a constant temperature and determining the time to 50% survival after direct transfer to constant, high temperatures. Results indicate that thermal acclimation influences heat resistance, and that heat resistance correlates with the species' geographic distribution and breeding habits. Tadpoles of the tropical treefrog, Hyla septentrionalis, and desert spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus couchii, were the most heat resistant; tadpoles of the western spadefoot toad, S. hammondii, from California were the next most heat resistant, and tadpoles of the Pacific treefrog, H. regilla, were the least resistant.

AB  - Adult male chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata) were collected from 14 breeding congregations situated along an altitudinal gradient running from approximately 1,500 m in the piedmont of northcentral Colorado to approximately 3,000 m in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Critical thermal maxima (CTMs), determined following acclimation of frogs at constant temperatures of 5⚬ C and 20⚬ C, were found to decline clinally with increasing elevation of the collecting sites. Since the decline in heat resistance with increasing elevation corresponds with a similar elevational gradient in ambient temperature, it appears that interpopulation variation in CTMs reflects physiological adaptation of chorus frogs to the different temperature conditions encountered at different localities.

TI  - The vulnerability of microhylid frogs, Cophixalus spp., to climate change in the Australian Wet Tropics
AU  - Merino-Viteri, Andrés Ricardo
AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon attributable to a change in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a consequence of human activities since the beginning of industrialisation. The change in climatic patterns direct and indirectly affects biodiversity by, for example, promoting geographic distribution changes (elevational or latitudinal) or affecting the biological interactions of species. These effects have been proposed to more severely affect ectotherms, especially in tropical regions. Tropical regions, due to annual climatic stability, may have promoted the evolution of species with reduced thermal tolerances.     The endemic Microhylid frogs, genus Cophixalus, of the Australian Wet Tropics Bioregion (AWT) are considered one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates of the region by climate change. This vulnerability mainly comes from a reduced geographic distribution, restricted to a one or few mountain tops in the coldest, wettest and aseasonal parts of the AWT. These nocturnal frogs are forest floor dwellers and reproduce via direct development (i.e. eggs are deposited terrestrially and development occurs within the egg with froglets hatching from the egg capsule). During day time they seek shelter from ambient environmental conditions in refuges (mainly under logs, rocks or fallen epiphytes). Correlative models of distribution of this group of frogs predict a reduction of suitable climatic area in the future, however the mechanisms behind the potential changes are poorly understood. The ecological characteristics of Cophixalus and their high regional species richness (thirteen species) make this group ideal to test hypotheses about factors that influence their geographical distribution limits and potentially will influence their response to future climates.     A more accurate assessment of the vulnerability of these Cophixalus frogs to climate change depends on the understanding of the conditions the species actually are exposed to and their sensitivity to environmental change. Exposure requires accurate microenvironmental data and an understanding of seasonal or daily behavioural activity, while sensitivity can be assessed by directly quantifying the physiological thermal tolerances of the animals.     Cophixalus frogs show a consistent daily and seasonal activity pattern showing adaptations to exploit available refuges with potentially better buffering capacity, which may be important to face warmer conditions in the future.     Based on behavioural observations, a sequence of actual exposure conditions for Cophixalus frogs was constructed. Exposure conditions were found to be behaviourally buffered from ambient air conditions (by nocturnality and microhabitat use). This magnitude of the buffering varies with season, being higher during the warmest months.     Sensitivity of Cophixalus frogs was directly measured using several techniques including a dynamic method to determine critical thermal maximum and minimum. The experimental device increased or decreased temperature at a rate of approximate 1˚C/minute, until organisms lost righting capacity. The analysis of the sensitivity of organisms to climate change must be based on empirical evidence, to improve the assessment of future climate impacts. Observed thermal tolerances and limits of the Australian Wet Tropics Cophixalus frogs was not predicted by phylogenetic history, but instead was correlated with contemporary environmental conditions associated with the geographical distribution of individual species. Cophixalus frogs have narrow thermal ranges that may be explained by their narrow geographical restriction to rainforest habitats. Historical stability of environmental conditions within this ecosystem, has been proposed as a major driver of species distribution patterns and subsequent geographic species richness in this region.     The maximum thermal tolerance (CTmax) of the eleven species of Cophixalus examined, ranged from 28.1 °C to 35.9 °C, and the minimum (CTmin) ranged from 8.6 °C to 14.3 °C. Thermal tolerance range was extremely narrow compared with other tropical anurans, even for the species with the widest tolerance, Cophixalus exiguus (25.5 °C). Mean and mode of the preferred temperature showed similar values ranging from 20 °C to 29 °C across the 13 species.     The combination of measured thermal tolerances, microenvironmental exposure and ecology of species will be fundamental for the development of more accurate assessment of vulnerability to climate change. For restricted species, the analysis of these factors may also allow the identification of parameters that may be limiting their distributions. In this study, available evidence suggests that thermal physiology parameters of individual Cophixalus frogs, such as CTmax is correlated to different distribution characteristics (e.g. maximum and mid-altitude of the species distribution).     These data also allow us to determine whether species are actually filling their fundamental thermal niche. It is suggested that some species are not filling their niche. This finding may open the possibility to explore conservation strategies that may include translocation of individuals to regions where they are not currently present but environmental conditions would not act as a limitation.     When predictions of temperature change are included in the analysis, the results may be used to guide decisions about the regions and time frames when conservation strategies are required. Climate conditions under present, and two future frames (2035 and 2065) were evaluated. Our results suggest that some species may be experiencing suppressed fitness due to environmental warming even under current environmental conditions. This decrease is related to exposure to conditions warmer than their preferred temperature. The exposure to these stressful conditions are expected to occur first in the lower elevational areas of the distribution and increase in magnitude into the future.     One of the most important findings of this research is that our data suggests that no population of any Cophixalus species occurring in the AWT will be exposed to temperatures that directly cause fatalities within the timeframes evaluated. This is important because it suggests that drastic interventions to avoid local extinctions will not be necessary by 2065. However, the potential for serious indirect, or synergistic, impacts remains.     It is possible too that physiological responses to environmental parameters other than temperature may limit distributions of Cophixalus species. Another contribution of this study was to develop an experimental apparatus capable of quantifying tolerance to desiccation in hard field conditions. We provide a description of the experimental apparatus and detailed methodology as an input for future studied focused on this environmental parameter and also include some preliminary data on desiccation rates as an appendix. Cophixalus frogs show an increase of water loss with temperature, implying an increase in vulnerability to drying in the future. Cophixalus neglectus in particular seems to be highly sensitive to desiccation. Cophixalus saxatilis presents low levels of desiccation that can be explained by larger size of the species and relative low relation between surface-area and volume of individuals. Cophixalus monticola shows low water loss rates compared to close relatives of similar size. This pattern may be related to specialisation on Limnospadix palms as a preferred microhabitat which may offer less protection against water loss than other microhabitats.     The combined information assembled in this research addresses some of the important knowledge gaps identified by national authorities, needed to improving the understanding of mechanisms behind climate change impacts. This new knowledge provides a basis for the development of more robust and accurate conservation strategies that will increase the success of adaptive management focused on the conservation of species threatened with extinction, such as the Australian endemic Cophixalus frogs.

Body temperatures ranged from 17.0 to 27.2 C (mean 21.3 t+ 2.4 C) with only 30.9 per cent of the observations exceeding ambient. The critical thermal minimum was 6.1 C (range 5.0-7.5 C) and is lower than previously reported values for B. marinus from Central America. The onset of spasms (range 37.8-39.5 C) varied significantly over a 24 hr period and appeared to show a temporal pattern in heat resistance for which the functional significance is unknown at present, but possibly has survival value for this toad during the breeding season. * * *

AB  - Climate change may have dramatic consequences for communities through both direct effects of peak temperatures upon individual species and through interspecific mismatches in thermal sensitivities of interacting organisms which mediate changes in interspecific interactions (i.e. predation). Despite this, there is a paucity of information on the patterns of spatial physiological sensitivity of interacting species (at both landscape and local scales) which could ultimately influence geographical variation in the effects of climate change on community processes. In order to assess where these impacts may occur, we first need to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity in the degree of mismatch in thermal tolerances between interacting organisms. We quantify the magnitude of interspecific mismatch in maximum (CT<sub>max</sub> ) and minimum (CT<sub>min</sub> ) thermal tolerances among a predator-prey system of dragonfly and anuran larvae in tropical montane (242-3631 m) and habitat (ponds and streams) gradients. To compare thermal mismatches between predator and prey, we coined the parameters maximum and minimum predatory tolerance margins (PTM<sub>max</sub> and PTM<sub>min</sub> ), or difference in CT<sub>max</sub> and CT<sub>min</sub> of interacting organisms sampled across elevational and habitat gradients. Our analyses revealed that: (1) predators exhibit higher heat tolerances than prey (~ 4 ºC), a trend which remained stable across habitats and elevations. In contrast, we found no differences in minimum thermal tolerances between these groups. (2) Maximum and minimum thermal tolerances of both predators and prey decreased with elevation, but only maximum thermal tolerance varied across habitats, with pond species exhibiting higher heat tolerance than stream species. (3) Pond-dwelling organisms from low elevations (0-1500 m a.s.l.) may be more susceptible to direct effects of warming than their highland counterparts because their maximum thermal tolerances are only slightly higher than their exposed maximum environmental temperatures. The greater relative thermal tolerance of dragonfly naiad predators may further increase the vulnerability of lowland tadpoles to warming due to potentially enhanced indirect effects of higher predation rates by more heat-tolerant dragonfly predators. However, further experimental work is required to establish the individual and population-level consequences of this thermal tolerance mismatch upon biotic interactions such as predator-prey.

AB  - Eggs of the Chinese Frest Frog (Rana chensinensis) collected from the wild immediately after they were laid out and were incubated at five different temperatures,10℃,15℃,20℃,25℃,and 30℃ in the condition of photoperiod 14L∶10D,and 85% moisture.The cultivation period lasted 10 days.Incubation periods at each temperature level,incubation ratio,thermal threshold of development,accumulative temperature,survival rate,preferred temperature,avoidance temperature and lethal thermal temperature of tadpole incubated were recorded after 3 days incubation.Linear regression methods and direct optimum methods were used to calculate the thermal thresholds of development and accumulative incubation temperature.The incubation ratio was significantly influenced by temperature,and the survival rate decreased with the increase of incubation temperature.The body-tail length of tadpoles was significantly influenced by the incubation temperature.The thermal thresholds of development were 0.51℃ or 0.38℃.Accumulative temperature for the incubation were 65.29℃·day or 65.52℃·day.The result of direct optimum method is better than that of linear regression method.The preferred temperature of the Chinese Forest Frog tadpoles incubated 10 days under incubation temperature were 13.2±1.6℃,15.7±1.9℃,17.3±2.1℃ and 19.5±2.3℃; avoidance temperature were 28.8±1.4℃,30.2±1.6℃,31.6±1.3℃ and 33.1±1.8℃,lethal thermal temperature were 32.9±1.7℃,33.8±1.5℃,35.2±1.2℃ and 36.7±0.9℃,respectively. The preferred temperature,avoidance temperature and lethal thermal temperature of tadpoles derived from eggs incubated for 10 days at 10℃,15℃,20℃ and 25℃ were significantly influenced by temperature.

T2  - Herpetologica Romanica
AB  - The small sized yellow-bellied toad inhabits small temporary water bodies. These puddles are used by this species in both open landscapes and closed forested habitats. The thermal characteristics of these puddles in the open and closed habitat types showed considerable difference. In laboratory conditions the toad selected a narrow and low preferred temperature range (20.5-23.3°C). The measured voluntary thermal maximum (VTMaxwater) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was 35.9 ± 1.3°C, and 38.3 ± 0.5°C respectively. In the field, the toads using the surface water layer were thermoconformers irrespective of the actual thermal environment. The high VTMaxwater and CTMax presumably permit the use of such a thermoregulatory strategy.

TI  - Tales of an ‘Invisible’ Life Stage: Survival and Physiology Among Terrestrial Juvenile Ambystomatid Salamanders
AU  - Messerman, Arianne F.
AB  - The vital rates (e.g., survival, growth, and reproduction) of distinct life stages within a species are known to influence the growth and persistence of populations. As such, studies describing stage-specific vital rates, and the factors that shape variation in these rates across species and populations, can help to improve our understanding of population dynamics and species distributions. Moreover, the insights gained from such studies can guide the prioritization of populations for conservation efforts and inform the selection of management strategies under predicted climate and land use changes. Yet life stage-specific vital rate estimates, and characterizations of the physiological responses that influence demographic rates under variable conditions, are lacking for most species.Amphibians are experiencing drastic population declines across the globe. As amphibians exhibit complex lifecycles, wherein unique life stages rely on divergent resources and habitat types, examinations of distinct life stages may be particularly critical for enhancing amphibian conservation efforts. Specifically, juveniles are known to play a critical role in amphibian population dynamics, but are relatively understudied compared with other life stages due to their small body size and often elusive life histories. The main objective of this dissertation was to elucidate survival rates, and physiological characteristics that contribute to survival, among terrestrial juveniles of multiple complex lifecycle pond-breeding salamanders in the genus Ambystoma.I first estimated juvenile survival rates among three ambystomatid species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum and A. texanum) by conducting an 11-month capture-mark- xiii recapture study within semi-natural enclosures. I found juvenile survival rates to be constant through time and comparable among species. These similarities indicated that vital rate estimates from congeneric, ecologically similar species can serve as robust place-holder information to examine the population dynamics of the many amphibian species for which stage-specific data are lacking. Next, I reared larvae of five species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. texanum) from populations along an ~200 km latitudinal gradient in Missouri, USA to metamorphosis under common conditions. By performing flow-through respirometry on juveniles, I found respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) and standard metabolic rates (SMR) to differ between species. Though SMR showed no relationship with locality, RSAWL was weakly positively correlated with latitude. This suggested that juvenile ambystomatids exposed to warmer average conditions at more southern latitudes, and thus a higher desiccation risk, may demonstrate the locally adaptive regulation of RSAWL compared with juveniles from northern populations. Given common rearing, it is likely that differences among species and populations had a genetic basis, and were not solely the result of phenotypic plasticity. I then conducted a replicated experiment to evaluate how juvenile RSAWL, SMR, and body mass might influence individual fitness by releasing A. maculatum and A. opacum juveniles from the previous study into the semi-natural enclosures for seven months of capture-mark-recapture. Examining known survival at three time points during the study, I found juveniles with higher initial body mass and/or lower SMR to have a higher likelihood of survival, particularly under warm initial conditions. There was no effect of RSAWL on survival. Acclimation experiments with surviving salamanders revealed that thermal tolerances and SMR demonstrated plastic responses to warming. Further, a simulation of juvenile survival following high temperatures suggested that the two study species may demonstrate diverging juvenile survival rates after being thermally challenged due to distinct acclimation strategies.Collectively, the results of these studies shed light on a key vital rate for ambystomatid population dynamics in a life stage that is difficult to observe. I compiled the findings of these and other ambystomatid studies to propose management objectives and strategies to conserve A. annulatum, an endemic species of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains. This effort demonstrated the utility of life stage-specific demographic and physiological information for guiding the conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Habitat Suitability for Eleutherodactylus Frogs in Puerto Rico: Indexing Occupancy, Abundance and Reproduction to Climatic and Habitat Characteristics
AU  - Rivera-Burgos, Ana Cecilia
AB  - What makes a habitat “suitable” for Eleutherodactylus frogs and can we predict the consequences of climate change on this taxonomic group in Puerto Rico? These questions stem by the fact that amphibian populations in Puerto Rico are declining, a trend also observed in other amphibians elsewhere in the world, and that one of the major drivers behind the negative trends is global warming. To help answer the aforementioned questions, I characterized the relationship between environmental and habitat variables, measured at the local/site level, and occupancy and the probability of detecting a chorus (≥ 4 individuals) of Eleutherodactylus wightmanae, E. brittoni, and E. antillensis, 3 species of differing size, distribution and habitat affinities. This understanding is important because shifts in abundance and distribution at larger scales begin with responses at local scales. Additionally, I determined how the same variables influenced nesting activity of E. coqui, a common and widely distributed species. Finally, I established critical thermal maximum for all 4 species as a means to gain insights on how they might respond to environmental change. Occupancy of E. wightmanae and E. brittoni was affected positively by physical/environmental covariates (e.g., relative humidity, elevation), while E. antillensis was not. Physical/environmental covariates also had a positive influence on detecting a chorus of E. wightmanae and E. brittoni, but negative on E. antillensis. Annual variation of macrohabitat covariates (e.g., ground cover) had a positive influence on E. brittoni and E. antillensis. The passing of Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 did not have a devastating effect on local population abundance, at least the sites that were accessible for monitoring. Relative humidity and temperature exerted the strongest influence on the probability of encountering active nests of E. coqui, where sites with ≤ 24 °C and ≥ 90% relative humidity had > 50% chance of having an active nest. E. brittoni (34.43 ± 0.9 ° C) and E. wightmanae (38.72 ± 1.62 °C) had statistically similar CTMax values. In contrast, CTMax for E. coqui and E. antillensis were 10-18 ° C higher. My findings help develop criteria to index habitat quality to facilitate managed translocations or in-situ habitat enhancement. My CTMax results suggest that it might be possible to group species according to their responses to ambient conditions, but also why the species does not occur below 200 m. The positive response to physical/environmental covariates by E. wightmanae and E. brittoni as compared to E. antillensis lend support to such a possibility. Taken together, my findings provide a stronger ecological basis to postulate hypotheses that more accurately test the potential linkages between environmental conditions and physiological, and ultimately, demographic responses of Eleutherodactylus frogs. Many conservation decisions, which depend on the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce, should be informed by a sound understanding of the species’ thermal window of tolerance and demographic responses to varying climatic conditions at local levels.

TI  - Thermal Physiology in a Widespread Lungless Salamander
AU  - Novarro, Alex J
AB  - Understanding species responses to climate change has become a top priority for conservation biologists. Unfortunately, current models often treat species as a single entity, ignoring population-level variation. This approach may result in major oversights when managing widespread species, which generally exhibit physiological variation across their geographic range. The eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is the most widely distributed Plethodon species, extending farther north than any other lungless salamander. This species’ geographic distribution raises two major questions: How does P. cinereus thrive across a wide range of temperatures, and does it possess thermal adaptations that will buffer the ecological consequences of climate change? To explore these questions, I first examined the effects of elevated temperature on metabolic hormone release rates and physiological performance (i.e., ingestion rate and mass gain) across a latitudinal population gradient. I found that physiological traits and populations differ in their thermal flexibility, and that salamanders from warmer localities are more resilient to elevated temperatures. Second, I performed a study to disentangle the environmental and evolutionary drivers of thermal limits across the geographic range of P. cinereus. I found strong support for evolutionary constraints on lower thermal limits, though there was some degree of plasticity in relation to local environmental temperatures. By contrast, upper thermal limits showed little variation across the species’ geographic range and among clades, and far exceeded survival requirements. Third, I combined laboratory experiments, field observations, and population models to explore the role of behavioral thermoregulation in shaping physiological performance in P. cinereus. I found that individuals are likely to exploit moist conditions at the cost of reduced performance, and that populations living in poor thermal quality habitats have greater thermoregulatory accuracy. Overall, my work demonstrates significant variation in thermal physiology across the geographic range and among lineages of P. cinereus and shows that thermal traits differ in their responsiveness to thermal variability. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering multiple physiological metrics and sampling large geographic areas to understand species’ abundance and distributions, and to assess species’ vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - Mechanisms of population divergence along elevational gradients in the tropics
AU  - Paez Vacas, Monica Isabel
AB  - Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to population divergence and eventually initiate speciation is a key step for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Most theories of differentiation and speciation have traditionally focused on geographically isolated populations. However, there is growing evidence that speciation can occur due to divergent selection despite initially high gene flow. My doctoral dissertation project investigates the effects of environmental heterogeneity and geography in promoting phenotypic and genetic divergence along elevation gradients in natural populations of a poison frog,  Epipedobates anthonyi, across the landscape with a focus on environmental variation along elevational gradients. I studied populations distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0–1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. First, I examined the relative roles of geographic distance and environmental gradients on genetic and phenotypic divergence. I found that populations are phenotypically divergent in size, color, and male advertisement calls, but they exhibit low genetic divergence at neutral loci. There is substantial gene flow between populations throughout the lowlands, but populations at higher elevations are relatively isolated. This is mainly due to a mountain ridge acting as a physical and possibly environmental barrier between northern and southern populations. Within elevational gradients, geographic distance corrected for topography is the main factor explaining both genetic and phenotypic divergence. However, when controlling for the effect of topographic distance, environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation between sites best explain observed patterns of genetic divergence, whereas environmental conditions at a given site best explains differences in phenotypic traits, presumably due to divergent selection pressures.    To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on adaptive divergence, I measured thermal tolerance of tadpoles across elevation. I found that populations from higher elevation had higher cold tolerance, suggesting that changes in temperature along elevation may cause divergent selection in thermal tolerance. Additionally, tadpoles from all sites have the ability to shift their thermal tolerance in response to previous exposure to different temperatures.   Finally, to examine the degree of local adaptation to environmental conditions at high and low elevations, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. I evaluated populations from high and low elevations from two elevational transects. Overall, I found that all populations have higher reproduction rates at low elevation. In fact, at high elevation, populations had very low reproductive rates or did not reproduce at all. However, variation in life-history traits differed between transects. Populations from one transect revealed a pattern that was consistent with the expectation under local adaptation, namely, low elevation frogs had higher reproduction than high elevation frogs at the low elevation site. In contrast, populations from the other transect had a pattern that would be expected under countergradient variation, namely higher elevation frogs had higher reproduction at the low elevation site. Intriguingly, low elevation frogs had overall higher reproduction rates than high elevation frogs, suggesting that frogs from low elevation have higher fecundity than their counterparts at high elevation.   Overall, the findings of my dissertation suggest that (i) phenotypic divergence occurs in the face of gene flow, (ii) environmental variation along elevation, particularly temperature, is a force that drives population divergence, and (iii) the influences of environmental conditions on populations are variable at the intraspecific level.

TI  - The thermal ecology of the Red-spotted toad, Bufo punctatus, across life history
AU  - Rausch, CM
AB  - Compared with other terrestrial vertebrates, amphibians are generally less tolerant of thermal extremes. The Mojave Desert has ambient temperatures outside the proposed thermal tolerance zone of its mort abundant amphibian, the Red-spotted toad (Bufo (Anaxyrus) punctatus). Few data have been presented regarding the thermal ecology of these animals, including their thermal histories and proposed strategies to avoid temperature extremes. Previous studies suggest B. punctatus avoids extreme thermal exposure and adult toads experience body temperature (Tb) below a proposed critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 35°C, and can maintain Tb at 25°C during the winter. Further, previous studies indicate a CTmax for tadpoles of 33°C. A reassessment of the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads was warranted based on personal observations reported in this thesis.    I recorded environmental and/or Tb of Red-spotted toads across their entire life history: eggs, tadpoles, juveniles and adults. In the field, eggs and tadpoles may encounter water temperatures as high as ~40°C. Juveniles can experience Tb as high as 42.2°C. Adult toads experience Tb as high as 39.1°C. These observations were combined with experimental determination of CTmax across life history statges: the CTmax of tadpoles was variable, but decreased as development progressed; adult toads exhibit a CTmax as high as 45.2 ± 1.0°C. I documented thermal preferences (Tp) of tadpoles and adults. In contrast to other studies of the effect of ontogeny on preferred temperature, Tp, of Red-spotted toads remains fairly constant across development. I documented developmental time from egg deposition to metamorphosis at 18 days in the summer and 47 days in the spring—both periods are less than the previously described 60-day developmental period. Finally, I present preliminary data on apparent basking-like behavior of late stage tadpoles in the field.    Despite seemingly high and presumably stressful environmental temperatures, Red-spotted toads do not generally live on the verge of thermal tolerance. However, later stage tadpoles may encounter potentially lethal temperatures. The collected data document the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads and contradict previously assumed limits that may not have been experimentally-derived. These data may allow informed decision making in land use and conservation efforts by better defining an important ecological parameter in a species that may be subjected to increased pressures by human activity and climatic change.

TI  - Variation in hsp70 levels and thermotolerance among terrestrial salamanders of the Plethodon glutinosus complex
AU  - Elwood, Jennifer R. Lorenz
AB  - The Plethodon glutinosus complex is a geographically widespread salamander group inhabiting forests throughout the eastern United States and is locally abundant throughout the coastal plain. As such it is exposed to a variety of climatic conditions and makes the perfect candidate group for examining large-scale variation in thermal tolerance limits and heat shock protein expression.    Thirteen populations of the P. glutinosus complex representing three physiographic regions were examined for variation in thermotolerant capabilities along environmental gradients. Measures of thermotolerance included the preferred temperature (PT), critical thermal maximum (CTM), and levels of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) as detected by ELISA.    Within the P. glutinosus complex there was an unexpected inverse relationship between the stress response and climate. While salamanders exhibited a significant amount of geographic variation in PT and CTM, there was a significant negative relationship between CTM and both geographic location and climate—salamanders from warm, southern climates had lower CTMs then salamanders from northern, cool climates. Hsp70 levels varied significantly among populations and physiographic regions but not among heat shocked or control treatment groups. In addition, piedmont populations contained significantly higher levels of hsp70 than either coastal plain or montane populations.    Patterns observed in the stress response of the P. glutinosus  complex reflect a “constitutive” based heat shock strategy. This strategy acknowledges that hsp70 induction incurs a fitness cost and that organisms from both relatively stable and highly disturbed habitats should trade-off inducible thermotolerance for high levels of constitutive protein. This strategy predicts that organisms from habitats with intermediate levels of disturbance would have the highest levels of inducible protein. However, because this confers a potentially high energetic cost, selection should ultimately push the population towards one side of the model or the other. Salamanders occupy relatively stable habitats on a global scale of disturbance, but even within these types of habitats trade-offs are evident. Piedmont salamanders which occupy the intermediately disturbed habitats had hsp70 levels that exceeded levels observed in both montane and coastal plain populations. Coastal plain populations behaviorally avoid stressful conditions and hence have stress responses similar to the lower stress montane populations.

TI  - The Comparative Ecologies of Two Species of Amphibia (B. bufo and B. calamita) on the Ainsdale Sand Dunes National Nature Reserve
AU  - Mathias, John Henry
AB  - The object of this study was to discover the behavioural, physiological and morphological differences between two closely related species of Amphibia: B. bufo and B. calamta in a limited habitat: the dune slacks on the Ainsdale Nature Reserve, and thus to suggest how they are able to survive together in an apparently stable manner. Interspecific contact was found to be reduced in the breeding seasons by: 1. Staggered times of emergence from hibernation so that the B. bufo season was almost complete by the time the B. calamita individuals entered the pools. 2. A preference by the individuals of the two species for different areas of the slacks for calling and egg laying purposes. 3. B. bufo were diurnal and B. calamita nocturnal. Hybrid mating was therefore rarer and it produced inviable spawn. The larvae of both species were present in the same pools but at different stages of development, and therefore probably had different food requirements. This was, however, thought to be the area of greatest interspecific conflict. Several morphological differences were noted between the larvae, and a means of larval identification was confirmed. In the non-breeding season, the two species seemed to prefer different habitats; B. calamita were found in less exposed situations with a variety of substrates and B. bufo were found in open areas, usually with a solid substrate. The North end of the Reserve was almost exclusively occupied by B. calamita during the non-breeding season. Both species became nocturnal after breeding was complete, and Natterjacks spent the days in burrows in dune ridges whereas Common Toads probably hid in vegetation and under objects. The Natterjacks were shown to have shorter hind limbs than Common Toads and this allowed increased, mobility on loose sand ridges, and facilitated digging. The physiological differences between the two species indicated a B. calamita adaptation to hotter conditions; this is also reflected by the more exclusively southern distribution of that species. The Natterjack larvae were tolerant of higher temperatures than common Toad larvae; at a given temperature the Common Toad larvae developed at a faster rate than the Natterjack larvae; Common Toad larvae were found id be more resistant to cold than Natterjack larvae. The adult Natterjack critical thermal maximum was 3.3°C higher than that of adult Common Toads. Other differences noted were the Common Toad adults were able to withstand greater desiccation than the Natterjack adults, and could also rehydrate at a faster rate; Natterjack adults and larvae were more tolerant to saline media than were the Common Toad adults and larvae. The significance of these tolerances in relation to the ecologies of the two species is discussed. The food intake of B. calamita and B. bufo adults was examined and certain differences in the importance of various food groups noted. Other topics covered include: breeding season population estimates and non-breeding season home range movements.

TI  - Trading heat and hops for water: Dehydration effects on locomotor performance, thermal limits, and thermoregulatory behavior of a terrestrial toad
AU  - Anderson, Rodolfo C. O.
AU  - Andrade, Denis V.
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Due to their highly permeable skin and ectothermy, terrestrial amphibians are challenged by compromises between water balance and body temperature regulation. The way in which such compromises are accommodated, under a range of temperatures and dehydration levels, impacts importantly the behavior and ecology of amphibians. Thus, using the terrestrial toad Rhinella schneideri as a model organism, the goals of this study were twofold. First, we determined how the thermal sensitivity of a centrally relevant trait-locomotion-was affected by dehydration. Secondly, we examined the effects of the same levels of dehydration on thermal preference and thermal tolerance. As dehydration becomes more severe, the optimal temperature for locomotor performance was lowered and performance breadth narrower. Similarly, dehydration was accompanied by a decrease in the thermal tolerance range. Such a decrease was caused by both an increase in the critical minimal temperature and a decrease in the thermal maximal temperature, with the latter changing more markedly. In general, our results show that the negative effects of dehydration on behavioral performance and thermal tolerance are, at least partially, counteracted by concurrent adjustments in thermal preference. We discuss some of the potential implications of this observation for the conservation of anuran amphibians.

T2  - The Australian Zoologist
AB  - Groups of tadpoles of Limnodynastes peronii (Anura, Myobatrachidae) were kept at two temperatures (15 degrees C and 25 degrees C) for 45-105 days. In a thermal gradient (6-36 degrees C), initial thermal preferenda were significantly different in 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C history groups, approximately 13 degrees C and 21 degrees C respectively. However, after 2.5 hours these initial differences were no longer seen and the final thermal preferendum was approximately 18 degrees C regardless of previous thermal history. Critical thermal maxima and LD50, increased following warm thermal history. Considering these results and the lack of metabolic acclimation reported elsewhere, these tadpoles can be seen as ectotherms whose thermal strategies are behavioural rather than physiological or biochemical. The rapid loss of acclimation of preferred temperature is discussed in relation to Fry's "final preferendum" paradigm.

AB  - Montane neotenic Ambystoma tigrinum had lower critical thermal maxima (CTM) than desert neotenic A. tigrinum. In all other life history stages studied there were no differences in CTM between montane and desert populations. Comparison of life history stages in a desert population showed that larvae and neotenic adults had higher CTM than transformed animals or animals in the process of transforming. The CTM differences in life history stages reflects the potential thermal stresses to which these stages may be subject.

AB  - We used Critical Thermal Methodology to quantify thermal     tolerance of the crab-eating frog, Fejervarya cancrivora, from Hoga     Island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The critical thermal maximum of     F. cancrivora was 42.1 ± 0.76 C, and is perhaps the highest thermal tolerance value known in an anuran acclimatized to 25 C. The frogs’ ability     to tolerate extreme high temperatures allows them to exploit abiotically     harsh mangal habitats and accounts for their wide distribution across the     tropical Pacific.

AU  - Nol

T2  - Copeia
AB  - Dissolved oxygen and temperature data from habitats frequented by the tadpoles of Rana pipiens and Bufo terrestris are related to laboratory studies of rates of oxygen consumption ( V̇ O2 ), Q10, critical oxygen tensions ( P c), and critical thermal maxima (CTM). Both species were acclimated to 22, 27 and 32 C for studies of physiological parameters. CTM was higher for both species in the earlier stages of development, and was higher in Bufo than in Rana at all temperatures. V̇ O2 was higher in Bufo tadpoles than in Rana. The P c increased with temperature in all stages of Bufo, but only in the younger stages of Rana. Field studies showed that Bufo tadpoles were found in warmer, more highly oxygenated microenvironments than were Rana tadpoles. It is suggested that shallow-water breeders, such as Bufo, emphasize adaptations to high temperatures, while permanent-water forms, such as Rana, emphasize adaptations to variations in oxygen availability.

AB  - Tadpoles of piedmont Pseudacris triseriata at 2-legged and 4-legged stages have higher critical thermal maxima (CTMs) than montane tadpoles at corresponding stages. In both the piedmont and the montane tadpoles, CTMs are lower in the later stage of development, and CTMs during metamorphic climax correspond closely to published values for CTMs of adult chorus frogs. Critical thermal maximum appears to be an important adaptation of chorus frog tadpoles, and altitudinal differences in CTM among adult frogs may merely reflect the important differences in CTM which are expressed during the tadpole stages.

AU  - Cupp, Paul V.

AB  - Critical thermal maxima (CTM) were determined at acclimation temperatures of 10, 20, and 30 C during larval development and metamorphosis in the frog and toad species Rana sylvatica, Pseudacris triseriata, Bufo americanus, Bufo woodhousei, and Gastrophryne carolinensis. Correlations were observed between geographic distribution and CTM, and breeding time and CTM for these species. In each species there was a significant decrease in CTM during metamorphosis. This was usually followed by an increase in CTM in adults. Adults usually had lower tolerance than larvae. The decrease in CTM during metamorphosis may reflect an adjustment downward in the thermal regime of a species so that metamorphosed young will be able to tolerate the low temperatures of winter. Tadpoles of B. americanus that were starved for 12 days had significantly lower CTM than those that were fed. Intraspecific differences in CTM were observed in tadpoles of G. carolinensis from different localities and in tadpoles of B. woodhousei collected from the same locality at different times. These differences may be due to differences in early thermal experience of embryonic stages.

The CTM of frogs acclimated to a cycled temperature regime of 10-30 C was the same as that for frogs acclimated to constant 30 C. Two-week unfed frogs had a lower thermal tolerance than frogs that had been fed daily. Larger individuals had a higher CTM. With a heating rate of 1 C/min, there was no difference in CTM of samples tested immediately after removal from acclimation temperatures compared to samples thermoequilibrated to 25 C for 1 hour after removal from acclimation.

AB  - Tadpoles of the tailed-frog, Ascaphus truei, exhibit distinct responses to temperature when placed in laboratory temperature gradients. Thermo-regulatory behavior is evidenced by an avoidance of temperatures above 22 C. Both first and second year tadpoles select over a wide temperature range (0-22 C), but first year animals tend to congregate below 10 C, whereas second year tadpoles aggregate above 10 C. Thermal acclimation had little influence on the preferendum of either year class, but photoperiod may alter the response of second year tadpoles to a temperature gradient.

AB  - Seasonal and latitudinal gradients in the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance have been examined in 10 species of hylids representing five different seasonal and distributional categories. Among temperate species, low-temperature performance is best in early-breeding northern species, intermediate in later-breeding northern species, and worst in southern species. Subtropical and tropical species have progressively higher critical thermal minima, but their thermal performance curves are not much different from those of southern temperate species in other respects. Critical upper thermal limits on jumping performance are much less variable than are lower limits, and the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) is not correlated with the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in our sample. Effectively, CTmax is relatively inflexible, and consequently an improvement in low-temperature performance (reduction in L80, the lowest temperature at which frogs can attain 80% of maximal performance) results in a widening of the thermal breadth of performance at or above some arbitrarily selected standard (e.g., B80, 80% of maximal performance). The strong negative correlation between L80 and B80 in our sample of hylids is not found in lizards. Differences in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance are strongly correlated with naturally experienced minimum body temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of locomotion may itself be (or may be correlated with) a mechanism underlying distributional differences and temporal partitioning of habitat among frogs. We suggest that some aspects of the community organization of hylids, such as breeding phenology and the depauperate faunas of high latitudes, are constrained at least in part by thermal physiology. Ecological consequences of this constraint are currently being investigated.

T2  - Physiological and Biochemical Zoology
AB  - We studied the role of plasma glucose concentration on individuals of Rhinella spinulosa in response to annual temperature variation and freezing temperatures. Measurements and collection of toads were made every 2 mo for a period of 1 yr. To determine whether toads were exposed to low temperatures in their habitat, we proceeded with the study of operating temperatures (Te). The measures of operating temperature were determined by using plaster models placed in the field, simulating the situation where toads are outside or inside shelters, for which it was determined that individuals in the winter season would have been exposed to temperatures below 0°C. Glucose levels measured in field specimens showed an annual variation, but laboratory specimens exposed to freezing temperatures had higher plasma glucose levels than field toads. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature for the species has been recorded at −1.6°C. The increase in glucose concentration indicates its possible use as a cryoprotectant before freezing events in this species of frogs and also in the coldest months at temperatures below 0°C.

AB  - The overwintering strategy of Litoria ewingii in Otago, New Zealand, was studied under laboratory and field conditions. Microhabitat temperature measurements showed that the frogs were often exposed to subzero temperatures. In the laboratory, Litoria ewingii tolerated freezing for up to 6 hrs at -1 degrees C, and after the completion of the freezing event (about 1 hr) at -2 degrees C. Frogs frozen with insulation survived freezing for 12 hrs at -1 degrees C. Frogs supercooled to -1.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C and -1.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C on wet and dry substrates respectively. L. Ewingii tolerated up to 47.5% of its body water frozen. Plasma glucose levels and osmolality were not increased during freezing. It is concluded that l. Ewingii cannot avoid freezing and is sufficiently freeze tolerant to survive the subzero temperatures encountered during winter in Otago.

TI  - Critical Thermal Capacities of Hyla chrysoscelis in Relation to Season
AU  - Litmer, Allison R.

T2  - Journal of Herpetology
AB  - As global climate change persists, ectotherm viability is of concern because of their reliance on the external thermal environment survival. Ecologically relevant data on temperatures inhabitable by a species can be acquired by assessing critical thermal capacities, which are often reflected by the behavior and physiology of an organism. For treefrogs, thermal capacities could be influenced by a variety of important factors and are important for assessing the impact of climate change. Here, we assessed critical thermal tolerance in Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) in Cookeville, Tennessee, in relation to capture date by measuring critical thermal maximum (CTmax), minimum (CTmin), and breadth over a season. The CTmax for H. chrysoscelis ranged from 28.2°C to 43.0°C, CTmin ranged from 1.0°C to 22.5°C, and breadth ranged from 8.0°C to 41.0°C. We found that frogs detected later in the season had significantly increased thermal breadths and significantly higher thermal tolerances, with a slight trend of greater cold tolerance. This study demonstrates that variability may exist in thermal tolerances within a population in relation to date, which may be a result of thermal acclimation. Variation in thermal capacity within a population may allow for persistence through climate change and is a useful knowledge for making future predictions.

AB  - The Japanese tree frog, a representative of the Manchurian fauna, is characterized by an outstanding cold resistance among the anuran amphibian species studied so far. Almost 70% of the specimens from the population inhabiting the middle Amur River withstand the cooling down to–30°C; some animals, down to–35°C. This exceeds more than twofold the cold hardiness of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus LeConte, 1825), which has been considered earlier to be the most cold-resistant species. The ability of H. japonica to survive for four months in the frozen state at low temperatures makes this species independent of the temperature overwintering conditions.

AB  - Only two species of boreal Holarctic frogs (genus Rana Linnaeus, 1758) can survive freezing and overwinter on land; they are found in the subarctic and cold regions of North America (Wood Frog, Rana sylvatica LeConte, 1825) and Eurasia (Moor Frog, Rana arvalis Nilsson, 1842) and are an example of an unusual adaptive strategy of overwintering. Freeze tolerance (down to –16 °C) of R. sylvatica has been thoroughly studied; however, little is known about cold resistance of R. arvalis in cold regions. We found that R. arvalis from European Russia and from West Siberia tolerate freezing down to –12 or –16 °C, whereas frogs from the Danish population survived freezing only to –4 °C (Y. Voituron et al. 2009b; J. Comp. Physiol. B, 179: 223–230). All of these populations, according to mitochondrial DNA markers, are closely related. We suggest that the observed differences in cold tolerance (–4 °C vs. –12 or –16 °C) could be caused either by adaptations to climatic factors or by differences in experimental protocols. The northeastern boundary of the geographic range of R. arvalis in Yakutia coincides with the transitional area between discontinuous and continuous permafrost; beyond this area, winter soil temperature sharply declines. The lower lethal temperature and overwintering ecology of R. arvalis in Siberia are similar to those of the North American R. sylvatica.

AB  - Paramos are high-elevation tropical Andean ecosystems above the tree line that display variable temperature and frequent freezing spells. Because a significant anuran community lives in this environment, physiological protection against freezing must characterise individuals in this community. Antifreeze protection has been studied in amphibians from other communities, and it is likely that Paramo anurans rely on the same underlying molecules that convey such protection to Nearctic species. However, given the pervasive presence of freezing spells in the Paramos year-round, the processes of activating protection mechanisms may differ from that of seasonal counterparts. Accordingly, this study investigated cryoprotection strategies in high-elevation tropical frogs, using as a model the terrestrial and nocturnal genus Pristimantis, specifically P. bogotensis, P. elegans and P. nervicus from Paramos, and the warm ecosystem counterparts P. insignitus, P. megalops and P. sanctaemartae. We focused on freeze tolerance and its relationship with glucose accumulation and ice formation. Under field conditions, the highest elevation P. nervicus exhibited higher glucose concentration at dawn compared to noon (1.7 ± 0.6 mmol/L versus 3.5 ± 1.32 mmol/L). Under experimental thermal freeze exposure for 2 hours between −2 and −4 ºC, the glucose concentration of the three Paramo species increased but physiological diversity was evident (P. nervicus 126%; P. bogotensis 100%; and P. elegans 55%). During this test, body ice formation was assessed calorimetrically. The species with the highest body ice formation was P. bogotensis (17% ± 5.37; maximum value: 63%; n = 8), followed by P. nervicus (5% ± 3.27; maximum value: 11%; n = 5) and P. elegans (0.34% ± 0.09; maximum value: 1%; n = 4). The study shows physiological diversity both within a genus and across the amphibian community around the freezing contour. Overall, Paramo species differ in freezing physiology from their low-elevation counterparts. Thus, climate shifts increasing freezing spells may affect the structure of communities in this zone.

TI  - Dehydration tolerance in wood frogs: a new perspective on development of amphibian freeze tolerance
AU  - Churchill, T. A.
AU  - Storey, K. B.
T2  - The American Journal of Physiology
AB  - Wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, tolerate the loss of 50-60% of total body water during experimental dehydration. The rate of water loss for unprotected frogs is the same whether animals are frozen (at -2 degrees C) or unfrozen (at 1 degrees C) but is greatly reduced when frogs are frozen under a protective layer of moss. Dehydrational death could occur in as little as 7-9 days for unprotected animals; this indicates the importance for winter survival of selecting well-protected and damp hibernation sites. Prior dehydration affected the cooling and freezing properties of frogs, reducing supercooling point and the amount of ice formed after 24 h at -2 degrees C and acting synergistically with freezing exposure in stimulating cryoprotectant synthesis. Analysis of the effects of controlled dehydration at 5 degrees C showed that changes in body water content alone (without freezing) stimulated liver glycogenolysis and the export of high concentrations of glucose into blood and other organs. Autumn-collected frogs dehydrated to 50% of total body water lost showed glucose levels of 165-1,409 nmol/mg protein in different organs, increases of 9- to 313-fold compared with control values and reaching final levels very similar to those induced by freezing exposure. The data support the proposal that various adaptations for natural freeze tolerance may have been derived from preexisting mechanisms for dealing with water stress in amphibians and that cell volume change may be one of the signals involved in triggering and sustaining molecular adaptations (e.g., cryoprotectant output) that support freezing survival.

AB  - Biological invasions are recognized as an important biotic component of global change that threatens the composition, structure and functioning of ecosystems, resulting in loss of biodiversity and displacement of native species. Although ecological characteristics facilitating the establishment and spread of non-native species are widely recognized, little is known about organismal attributes underlying invasion success. In this study, we tested the effect of thermal acclimation on thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in the invasive Xenopus laevis and the Chilean native Calyptocephalella gayi. In particular, the maximal righting performance (μMAX), optimal temperature (TO), lower (CTmin) and upper critical thermal limits (CTmax), thermal breadth (Tbr) and the area under the performance curve (AUC) were studied after 6 weeks acclimation to 10 and 20°C. We observed higher values of μmax and AUC in X. laevis in comparison to C. gayi. On the contrary, the invasive species showed lower values of CTmin in comparison to the native one. In contrast, CTmax, TO and Tbr showed no inter-specific differences. Moreover, we found that both species have the ability to acclimate their locomotor performance and lower thermal tolerance limit at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that X. laevis is a better performer than C. gayi. Although there were differences in CTmin, the invasive and native frogs did not differ in their thermal tolerance. Interestingly, in both species the lower and upper critical thermal limits are beyond the minimal and maximal temperatures encountered in nature during the coldest and hottest month, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that both X. laevis and C. gayi would be resilient to climate warming expectations in Chile.

TI  - Response to thermal and hydric regimes point to differential inter- and intraspecific vulnerability of tropical amphibians to climate warming
AU  - Delgado-Suazo, Peter
AU  - Burrowes, Patricia A.
T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - In Puerto Rico, an island threatened by climate warming, only one of two species of frogs that share part of their distribution has undergone a recent range contraction to higher elevations. We questioned if differences in their physiological response to temperature and dehydration might explain this distributional change. We studied a lowland and a highland population of Eleutherodactylus coqui, a widespread generalist, and E. portoricensis, an endangered species that is currently found only above 600 m. We compared various physiological aspects: operative temperature; temperature selection; critical temperatures; and their response to jumping performance tests at various thermal and hydric regimes. Results revealed that E. portoricensis had the highest CTmin and lowest CTmax and selected a cooler range of temperatures from the experimental gradient. Jumping performance increased with temperature for the three populations until attaining maximum performance. Afterwards, performance dropped drastically until reaching CTmax. Dehydration had a negative effect on performance for both species, particularly on maximum performance. This effect was greatest for E. portoricensis, followed by high-elevation E. coqui. The significantly greater thermo-hydric physiological limitations of E. portoricensis may explain its recent range contraction, potentially, as a response to climate warming. Low-elevation E. coqui had the lowest operative warming tolerance and was the only population to select temperatures like those encountered in their environment, indicating it may be narrowly adapted to local thermal conditions and thus, also vulnerable to climate change. Our results point towards plasticity in the response of E. coqui to varying climatic conditions, and present evidence of different physiological responses between closely related species at the same locality. This work highlights the importance of studying the combined effects of temperature and hydration to understand the response of ectotherms to warming environments and presents further evidence that desiccation may be a limiting factor determining which species may survive.

TI  - Distribution, Ecology, Disease and Physiology of a Mountain-Top Endemic Frog in the Face of Climate Change: A Study on Philoria loveridgei
AU  - Familiar Lopez, Mariel
AB  - Evidence clearly shows that climate change has affected ecosystems and individual species, challenging species survival and increasing extinction rates. Assessing species vulnerability to climate change is a key topic in ecology and conservation biology. Uncertainty remains as to which species will be most vulnerable and to what extent. An integrative framework has been developed to guide research towards evaluating species vulnerability. This approach proposes that a species’ vulnerability to climate change is dependent upon the synergistic combination of intrinsic (sensitivity) and extrinsic (exposure) factors. Following this framework, I examined how (i) sensitivity to environmental change (i.e. changes in calling phenology, thermal tolerances, and disease susceptibility) and (ii) exposure to environmental change (i.e. detectability, occupancy and species distribution, and thermal environment and microhabitat buffering) influenced the vulnerability of Philoria loveridgei, a direct-developing anuran, in subtropical rainforests of mid-eastern Australia. This allowed me to evaluate the vulnerability of this species to climate change. Sensitivity results indicated that calling phenology and breeding phenology of P. loveridgei were influenced primarily by the spring and early summer rainfall events associated with the start of the calling season. I hypothesise that these rainfall events increase soil moisture, and hence increase P. loveridgei nest moisture and subsequently forming a suitable environment for egg and larval survival. These early summer rainfall events would therefore cue the onset of the calling, associated with breeding. A diurnal calling pattern was identified for P. loveridgei, with a higher calling frequency during the early morning hours.

TI  - Thermal tolerance of the common coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in East Hawaii along an elevation gradient
AU  - Haggerty, Jacqueline
AB  - Natural variation in the environment can be tolerated by animals via behavioral modification, adaptation, or physiological or developmental plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity, or acclimation, allows individuals to adjust physiological parameters to best suit the needs of their environment. Acclimation to temperature is a feature of successful invasive species and may be a contributing factor to the expansion of the coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in its introduced range in Hawaii. Coqui frogs have been recorded on Hawaii Island since the late 1980s and pose a noise nuisance to humans. If the frogs expand into higher elevation, montane habitats, they may disrupt the ecosystems with noise and food web disturbances. The minimum tolerance of cold temperatures of coqui frogs along an elevational gradient in East Hawaii was measured and compared. Coqui frogs were found to have a flexible range of cold temperature tolerance, with differences in cold tolerance between populations, evidence of acclimation to lower temperatures, sex-specific thermal tolerance, and a lower thermal tolerance level in Hawaii than in their native Puerto Rico. However, a higher tolerance for cold did not correlate directly with elevation and there were no appreciable differences in hematocrit, plasma osmolality, or heart mass between acclimation treatments or populations. The overall range of shift in thermal tolerance after acclimation was 2–3°C, implying the thermal flexibility of coqui frogs may enable them to further expand their habitat in Hawaii to cooler, high elevation areas. Particularly sensitive areas should be monitored and managed to minimize ecosystem threats from coqui frogs.

AB  - <p>Investigating how highland amphibians respond to changes in ambient temperature may be of great significance for their fate prediction and effective conservation in the background of global warming. Here, using field individuals as the control group, we investigated the influence of high temperatures (20.5 and 25.5°C) and heat wave (15–26.6°C) on the thermal preference, critical thermal limits, locomotor performance, oxidative stress, and antioxidant enzyme activities in high-altitude frog <italic>Nanorana pleskei</italic> (3,490 m) endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). After 2 weeks of acclimation to high temperatures and heat wave, the thermal preference (T<sub>pref</sub>), critical thermal maximum (CT<sub>max</sub>), and range of tolerable temperature significantly increased, while the critical thermal minimum (CT<sub>min</sub>) was significantly decreased. The total time of jump to exhaustion significantly decreased, and burst swimming speed significantly increased in frogs acclimated in the high temperature and heat wave groups compared with the field group. In the high temperature group, the level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lipid peroxide (malondialdehyde, MDA), as well as the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) significantly increased in the liver or muscle. However, in the heat wave group, the MDA content significantly decreased in the liver, and antioxidants activities decreased in the liver and muscle except for CAT activities that were significantly increased in the liver. These results indicated that <italic>N. pleskei</italic> could respond to the oxidative stress caused by high temperatures by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The heat wave did not appear to cause oxidative damage in <italic>N. pleskei</italic>, which may be attributed to the fact that they have successfully adapted to the dramatic temperature fluctuations on the QTP.</p>

AB  - Mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) are ideally suited for predicting the nonnative distributions of invasive species, but require accurate parameterization of key functional traits. Importantly, any ability of the invader to acclimate or adapt rapidly to local conditions must be incorporated. Our field and laboratory studies measured phenotypic variation and tested for plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance and low-temperature tolerance of adult cane toads Bufo marinus in eastern Australia. We used a biophysical model to explore the adaptive significance of this variation and how it affected distribution predictions. Laboratory trials showed that geographic differences in low-temperature tolerance (i.e., the critical thermal minimum; CTMin) of field-caught toads reflect thermal acclimation, whereas populations differed in the thermal dependence of locomotor performance even after acclimation. Incorporating low-temperature tolerance as a dimension of the fundamental niche reduced the predicted southern distribution. To test whether these factors predicted to be range limiting were consistent with reduced performance for individuals, we used the biophysical model and daily climate data to conduct “virtual transplants.” These models predicted that acclimation reduced cold stress by 32–100% for toads sheltering near the ground surface; toads inside burrows could remain above their CTMin, but the required burrow depth increased with latitude. Low-temperature tolerance of the adult phase may constrain the southern range limit of the cane toad in Australia, and plasticity in this trait may have facilitated the southward range expansion.

T2  - The Journal of Experimental Zoology
AB  - Interstudy differences have been reported in the cryobiology of Hyla versicolor, especially for southern vs. northern populations, although laboratory conditioning likely was a contributing factor. This study measured freeze tolerance and cryoprotectant levels in H. versicolor from a southern population (Illinois). Frogs fully tolerated freezing at -1.5 and -3.5 degrees C for 24-48 hr but their survival rate declined at -5.5 degrees C (< 50%). Calorimetry revealed that 46% of the body water froze after 24 hr at -1.5 degrees C. Levels of plasma glucose and glycerol were substantially elevated, 14x and 5x respectively, in recently thawed frogs vs. unfrozen frogs. Plasma osmolality correspondingly rose from 242 to 304 mOsmol/L. Three unfrozen frogs had levels of plasma glycerol ranging between 17.1-36.8 mmol/L, suggesting an anticipatory response to freezing, but another three unfrozen frogs had a glycerol level of 1.1 mmol/L. A direct relationship existed between glycerol content and plasma osmolality and an inverse relationship was observed between plasma osmolality and ice content. Glycerol clearly was a major component of cryo-protectant production in these frogs, which was likely essential to their freeze tolerance. The cryobiology of Illinois frogs was only marginally less developed than seen in northern populations of this species.

AB  - Critical thermal minima (CTMin) were determined for three species of Hyla acclimated to 25.0 ± 1.0 C. The CTMin increased approximately 1.5 C among sympatric H. chrysoscelis, H. cinerea and H. gratiosa respectively. This trend is consistent with the northern limit of distribution for each species. The mean CTMin of H. cinerea was significantly greater in a southern than a northern population sample, but no difference existed between a northern and southern populations of H. chrysoscelis. Natural hybrids between H. cinerea and H. gratiosa had CTMin values that were intermediate to the parental species. Overall, the CTMin in these treefrogs changed parallel to the constraints of the natural thermal environment.

TI  - Ecology and Evolution of Geographic Range Size Variation in North American Plethodontid Salamanders: Perspectives from Thermal Physiology
AU  - Markle, Tricia
AB  - Species exhibit remarkable variation in geographic range size. Understanding the causes of this variation is fundamental to the fields of ecology and evolution, and is central to understanding how species will respond to rapid climate change. Using eastern North America's species-rich salamander fauna, I explore whether seasonal variation in temperature and climatic tolerance evolution underlie geographic range size variation (as per the climate variability hypothesis). First, I determined critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) temperatures of 18 salamander species. I then tested for relationships between thermal tolerances, seasonality, and geographic range size. Localities with greater annual temperature ranges (seasonality) were found to have individuals with broader thermal tolerances, and correspondingly species with larger latitudinal extents. Intraspecific tests, however, found only one of six wide-ranging species to relate thermal tolerances to environmental temperature changes across the range. Next, I estimated acclimation ability of salamanders to see if species with larger distributions have greater physiological plasticity. Salamanders were acclimated to 14 and 22�C and results of a phylogenetically controlled MCMCglmm model indicated that there are significant differences in temperature adjusted standard metabolic rates (SMRs) of species with wide versus narrow latitudinal extents. Wide-ranging species showed a slight increase in SMR after acclimation, whereas narrow-ranging species showed a statistically significant drop in SMR. These results indicate that wide-ranging species have a greater thermal acclimation capacity than narrow-ranging species. Finally, using GIS-based climate data I included all available locality points to estimate species-level thermal niche breadths. I found that CTMax and CTMin of species are strongly correlated with the maximum and minimum temperatures that occur within their geographic ranges. I also found that species' thermal tolerance breadths (CTMax) CTMin) are highly correlated with estimates of their thermal niche breadths. My general finding that wide-ranging species have broader physiological tolerances than narrow-ranging species supports key predictions of the climate variability hypothesis and the role of seasonality in the evolution of physiological traits. It also highlights the potential vulnerability of narrow-ranging montane salamanders.

T2  - Functional Ecology
AB  - 1. The cane toad (Rhinella marina) invasion of Australia has now reached areas much colder than most of its native range in tropical America. Understanding the toad's ability to function in such conditions can clarify its potential for further spread. 2. In northeastern New South Wales (NSW), cane toads have been recorded up to 1100 m above sea level (asl). Our monitoring over summer 2012–2013 confirmed that ground temperatures were lower at three high-elevation (750–1010 m asl) sites than at two nearby lower (100–210 m asl) sites (by day, 18°C vs. 25°C; at night, 17–18°C vs. 20–25°C, respectively). 3. Critical thermal minima (CTmins) of field-collected toads (loss of the righting reflex) were lower for high-elevation than low-elevation toads (5·5°C vs. 7·5°C), but laboratory acclimation abolished this difference. A toad's CTmin was not affected by site of collection, nor by 1 month's exposure to warm (24°C) or cool (12°C) conditions; instead, a toad's CTmin was determined by its thermal exposure over the previous 12 h. Locomotor ability was affected by test temperature, by elevation and by acclimation. Toads from high elevations exhibited equal endurance at cold and warm test temperatures after month-long acclimation to cold conditions, whereas toads from low elevations performed better at high temperatures regardless of previous temperature treatments. 4. Cane toads at the southern edge of their expanding Australian range can function under cool conditions by adjusting their thermal tolerance within a few hours of encountering low temperatures. 5. The toads' ability for rapid thermal acclimation suggests that current models underestimate the potential range of abiotic conditions accessible to this invading species.

T2  - Conservation Physiology
AB  - Physiological plasticity may facilitate invasion of novel habitats; but is such plasticity present in all populations of the invader or is it elicited only by specific climatic challenges? In cold-climate areas of Australia, invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) can rapidly acclimate to cool conditions. To investigate whether this physiological plasticity is found in all invasive cane toads or is only seen in cool climates, we measured the acclimation ability of toads from across Australia and the island of Hawai’i. We collected toads from the field and placed them at either 12 or 24°C for 12 h before measuring their righting response as a proxy for critical thermal minimum (CTmin). Toads from the coolest Australian region (New South Wales) demonstrated plasticity (as previously reported), with exposure to 12°C (vs. 24°C) decreasing CTmin by 2°C. In toads from other Australian populations, CTmins were unaffected by our thermal treatments. Hawai’ian toads from a cool, wet site also rapidly acclimated to cool conditions, whereas those from warmer and drier Hawai’ian sites did not. Thermal plasticity has diverged among populations of invasive cane toads, with rapid acclimation manifested only in two cool-climate populations from widely separated sites. Predictions about the potential range of invasive species thus must consider the possibility of geographic (intraspecific) heterogeneity in thermal plasticity; data from other parts of the species’ range may fail to predict levels of plasticity elicited by thermal challenges.

T2  - Conservation Physiology
AB  - Understanding rapid adaptation to novel environments is essential as we face increasing climatic change. Invasive species are an ideal system for studying adaptation as they are typically introduced to novel environments where they must adapt if they are to persist. We used the invasive cane toad, Rhinella marina, to investigate the contribution of plasticity and evolution to rapid adaptation in a novel environment. Rhinella marina is a neotropical toad that has invaded areas with climates outside of its native environmental niche. The goal of this research was to understand how cane toads persist in northern Florida, the coldest region of their combined natural and invasive range, and originally thought to be beyond their thermal breadth. We measured Critical thermal minima in cane toads from the original, warm introduction location (Miami), and their northern range edge (Tampa) to determine whether northern toads were more cold-tolerant, and to examine the contribution of adaptive plasticity and evolution to any changes in tolerance. Our results show that following acclimation to cold temperatures, southern toads are less tolerant of cold than northern toads. This persistent population difference implies selection for cold-tolerance in northern populations. Differences in individual responses indicate that plasticity is also involved in this response. Our findings have implications for conservation because predatory cane toad invasions threaten local faunas, especially native amphibians. Characterizing specific adaptive mechanisms that allow R. marina to expand its range will identify evolutionary processes that shape a highly successful invasive species.

AU  - Siddons, Spencer R.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - The ability of an organism to tolerate seasonal temperature changes, such as extremely cold temperatures during the winter, can be influenced by their pathogens. We tested how exposure to a virulent fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), affected the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of two frog species, Hyla versicolor (gray treefrog) and Lithobates palustris (pickerel frog). The CTmin is the minimum thermal performance point of an organism, which we estimated via righting response trials. For both frog species, we compared the righting response of Bd-exposed and Bd-unexposed individuals in either a constant (15ºC) environment or with decreasing temperatures (−1°C/2.5 min) starting from 15°C. The CTmin for both species was higher for Bd-exposed frogs than unexposed frogs, and the CTmin of H. versicolor was higher than L. palustris. We also found that Bd-exposed frogs of both species righted themselves significantly fewer times in both decreasing and constant temperature trials. Our findings show that pathogen exposure can reduce cold tolerance and limit the thermal performance range of hosts, which may lead to increased overwintering mortality.

AB  - Mechanistic bases for freezing tolerance in anurans have been well-studied only in wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, so comprehensive explanations for the mechanisms and evolution of freezing tolerance in anurans are lacking. We measured crystallization temperatures, freezing tolerance/intolerance, and tissue glucose and glycogen phosphorylase activities in frozen and unfrozen winter-acclimated Pseudacris triseriata, Bufo cognatus and B. woodhousei. Freezing occurred at higher subzero temperatures on wet substrate than on dry substrate in all species, indicating susceptibility to inoculative freezing. P. triseriata was freeze-tolerant, but survival was dependent on the level of supercooling prior to freezing. All Bufo were freezing intolerant, regardless of crystallization temperature. Glucose was significantly elevated by freezing in both liver (35-fold) and leg muscle (22-fold) in winter P. triseriata, but only liver glucose was significantly elevated in B. cognatus. However, freezing did not alter glycogen phosphorylase activity in either species. Liver phosphorylase activity was significantly higher in P. triseriata than in B. cognatus, suggesting that capacity for mobilizing glucose from liver glycogen is associated with freezing tolerance. Summer measurements of liver phosphorylase activity, however, did not differ between species. Thus, P. triseriata, but not B. cognatus, exhibited winter increment of liver phosphorylase activity that is correlated with the development of freezing tolerance.

AU  - Vo, Pacific
AU  - Gridi-Papp, Marcos
T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Many frogs from temperate climates can tolerate low temperatures and increase their thermal tolerance through hardening and acclimation. Most tropical frogs, on the other hand, fail to acclimate to low temperatures. This lack of acclimation ability is potentially due to lack of selection pressure for acclimation because cold weather is less common in the tropics. We tested the generality of this pattern by characterizing the critical temperature minimum (CTMin), hardening, and acclimation responses of túngara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). These frogs belong to a family with unknown thermal ecology. They are found in a tropical habitat with a highly constant temperature regime. The CTMin of the tadpoles was on average 12.5°C. Pre-metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 1.18°C, while metamorphic tadpoles hardened by 0.36°C. When raised at 21°C, tadpoles acclimated expanding their cold tolerance by 1.3°C in relation to larvae raised at 28°C. These results indicate that the túngara frog has a greatly reduced cold tolerance when compared to species from temperate climates, but it responds to cold temperatures with hardening and acclimation comparable to those of temperate-zone species. Cold tolerance increased with body length but cold hardening was more extensive in pre-metamorphic tadpoles than in metamorphic ones. This study shows that lack of acclimation ability is not general to the physiology of tropical anurans.

AB  - Freeze tolerance and changes in metabolism during freezing were investigated in the moor frog (Rana arvalis) under laboratory conditions. The data show for the first time a well-developed freeze tolerance in juveniles of a European frog capable of surviving a freezing exposure of about 72 h with a final body temperature of −3°C. A biochemical analysis showed an increase in liver and muscle glucose in response to freezing (respectively, 14-fold and 4-fold between 4 and −1°C). Lactate accumulation was only observed in the liver (4.1 ± 0.8 against 16.6 ± 2.4 μmol g−1 fresh weight (FW) between 4 and −1°C). The quantification of the respiratory metabolism of frozen frogs showed that the aerobic metabolism persists under freezing conditions (1.4 ± 0.7 μl O2 g−1 FW h−1 at −4°C) and decreases with body temperature. After thawing, the oxygen consumption rose rapidly during the first hour (6-fold to 16-fold) and continued to increase for 24 h, but at a lower rate. In early winter, juvenile R. arvalis held in an outdoor enclosure were observed to emerge from ponds and hibernate in the upper soil and litter layers. Temperature recordings in the substratum of the enclosure suggested that the hibernacula of these juvenile frogs provided sheltering from sub-zero air temperatures and reduced the time spent in a frozen state corresponding well with the observed freeze tolerance of the juveniles. This study strongly suggests that freeze tolerance of R. arvalis is an adaptive trait necessary for winter survival.

AB  - Desert species, especially ectotherms, experience temperature-related challenges throughout their lives. Temperature affects many aspects of ectotherm physiology, including immune function. The goal of this study was to investigate how temperature affects the immune system of a common desert toad, Anaxyrus punctatus. We used three well-known eco-immunological techniques (bacterial lysis, hemagglutination and phytohaemagglutinin assays) to measure aspects of immune performance across temperature. Field and preferred temperatures were used to determine the temperatures utilized in the immunological assays. We found that temperature affects bactericidal and hemagglutination capacity in this species, but not inflammatory response. We also found that bactericidal and hemagglutination capacity are optimal at extremely high temperatures compared to the preferred temperature of this species or extremely low temperatures. These results have implications for disease management in desert amphibians as well as the vulnerability of this species to emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - Can Newts Cope with the Heat? Disparate Thermoregulatory Strategies of Two Sympatric Species in Water
AU  - Balogová, Monika

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Many ectotherms effectively reduce their exposure to low or high environmental temperatures using behavioral thermoregulation. In terrestrial ectotherms, thermoregulatory strategies range from accurate thermoregulation to thermoconformity according to the costs and limits of thermoregulation, while in aquatic taxa the quantification of behavioral thermoregulation have received limited attention. We examined thermoregulation in two sympatric newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris, exposed to elevated water temperatures under semi-natural conditions. According to a recent theory, we predicted that species for which elevated water temperatures pose a lower thermal quality habitat, would thermoregulate more effectively than species in thermally benign conditions. In the laboratory thermal gradient, L. vulgaris maintained higher body temperatures than I. alpestris. Semi-natural thermal conditions provided better thermal quality of habitat for L. vulgaris than for I. alpestris. Thermoregulatory indices indicated that I. alpestris actively thermoregulated its body temperature, whereas L. vulgaris remained passive to the thermal heterogeneity of aquatic environment. In the face of elevated water temperatures, sympatric newt species employed disparate thermoregulatory strategies according to the species-specific quality of the thermal habitat. Both strategies reduced newt exposure to suboptimal water temperatures with the same accuracy but with or without the costs of thermoregulation. The quantification of behavioral thermoregulation proves to be an important conceptual and methodological tool for thermal ecology studies not only in terrestrial but also in aquatic ectotherms.

AU  - Puckett, Rosemary E.
T2  - Journal of Experimental Zoology. Part A, Ecological Genetics and Physiology
AB  - Eastern red-spotted newts are ectotherms, aquatic as adults, and active year-round, breeding even during winter under ice. Earlier research, with field-captured newts, showed a correlation between seasonal changes in the activity of some muscle metabolic enzymes and in the behavior of the newts in a thermal gradient. This study was undertaken to further characterize acclimatory responses in the newts in a more controlled laboratory environment. Newts were obtained during fall, and maintained at 15 degrees C with 12:12 LD for 4 weeks for SMR (at 8 and 26 degrees C) and temperature preference experiments. Subsequently, half the newts were exposed to summer conditions (26 degrees C, 14:10 LD) and half to winter conditions (8 degrees C, 10:14 LD). After 12 weeks, SMR and temperature preference experiments were repeated, and enzyme assays for cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), citrate synthase (CS), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were performed on muscle tissue homogenates, also at 8 and 26 degrees C. Newts changed all three parameters in the laboratory. SMRs were highest in winter-acclimated newts and lowest in summer-acclimated newts, whereas temperature preference was lowest in winter-acclimated newts and highest in summer-acclimated newts. Finally, CCO activity was completely compensated in winter-acclimated newts, CS activity was partially compensated, and LDH activity was not seasonally sensitive. These results indicate a connection or relationship between changes in seasonal environmental conditions, and some aspects of the muscle biochemistry, SMR, and thermoregulatory behavior of these ectotherms.

AB  - While epizootics increasingly affect wildlife, it remains poorly understood how the environment shapes most host–pathogen systems. Here, we employ a three-step framework to study microclimate influence on ectotherm host thermal behaviour, focusing on amphibian chytridiomycosis in fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) infected with the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). Laboratory trials reveal that innate variation in thermal preference, rather than behavioural fever, can inhibit infection and facilitate salamander recovery under humidity-saturated conditions. Yet, a 3-year field study and a mesocosm experiment close to the invasive Bsal range show that microclimate constraints suppress host thermal behaviour favourable to disease control. A final mechanistic model, that estimates range-wide, year-round host body temperature relative to microclimate, suggests that these constraints are rule rather than exception. Our results demonstrate how innate host defences against epizootics may remain constrained in the wild, which predisposes to range-wide disease outbreaks and population declines.

AU  - Bicego, Kenia C.
AU  - Branco, Luiz G. S.
T2  - Journal of Experimental Biology
AB  - The preoptic area (POA) plays an important role in fever in mammals, but the role of this region in fever in ectothermic vertebrates has never been assessed. Toads, like all ectotherms, regulate their body temperature(Tb) primarily by behavior and develop behavioral fever when injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the POA plays a role in the behavioral fever induced by LPS in the toad Bufo paracnemis. We made electrolytic lesions in the POA of toads (0.3 mA, 8 s) and measured preferred Tb using a thermal gradient. After a period of 24h inside the gradient chamber, control,sham-operated and lesioned toads were systemically injected with LPS (200μg kg-1) or pyrogen-free saline. There was no significant effect of POA lesion in animals at their normal preferred Tb. LPS caused a significant increase in preferred Tb of control and sham-operated toads, but lesions in the POA abolished this response. These results indicate that the POA is an important site in the central nervous system of toads, and perhaps of all vertebrates, involved in the development of fever.

AB  - Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a nonmammalian analog of the mammalian hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). These peptides are known for their antidiuretic and pressor effects. More recently, AVP has been recognized as an important antipyretic molecule in mammals. However, no information exists about the role of AVT in febrile ectotherms. We tested the hypothesis that AVT is an antipyretic molecule in the toadBufo paracnemis. Toads equipped with a temperature probe were placed in a thermal gradient, and preferred body temperature was recorded continuously. A behavioral fever was observed after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected systemically (200 μg/kg). Systemically injected AVT (300 pmol/kg) alone caused no significant change in body temperature, but abolished LPS-induced fever. Moreover, a smaller dose of AVT (10 pmol/kg), which did not affect LPS-induced fever when injected peripherally, abolished fever when injected intracerebroventricularly. We therefore conclude that AVT plays an antipyretic role in the central nervous system, by means of behavior, in an ectotherm, a fact consistent with the notion that AVT/AVP elicits antipyresis by reducing the thermoregulatory set point.

T2  - Journal of Experimental Zoology
AB  - Estivation is accompanied by a reduction of oxygen consumption in amphibians during drought. We tested the hypothesis that, during the dry season, the toad Bufo paracnemis selects a lower preferred body temperature (Tb), and would be less sensitive to hypoxia, than during its active period. Therefore, during winter (dry season in São Paulo state, Brazil) and summer, we measured the effects of hypoxia (7% inspired O2) on preferred Tb. Additionally, pulmonary ventilation, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were also measured in toads at 15 and 25°C. Blood gases were measured at 25°C. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher during summer in toads at 25°C. Under normoxia, preferred Tb was higher during summer than during winter, and hypoxia caused a drop in preferred Tb during both seasons. In both seasons, toads at 15°C showed reduced pulmonary ventilation, heart rate, and blood pressure, and hypoxia had no effect. At 25°C during summer only, hypoxia caused an increase in ventilation. Season had no effect on blood gases. We conclude that B. paracnemis displays an endogenous seasonal pattern of thermoregulation and control of ventilation. The decreased preferred Tb and the physiological responses to hypoxia may be beneficial to toads encountering drought and when food is not available. J. Exp.

TI  - Terrestrial Salamanders Alter Antipredator Behavior Thresholds Following Tail Autotomy
AU  - Bliss, Margaret M.

T2  - Herpetologica
AB  - Prey animals avoid and survive encounters with predators through morphological and behavioral mechanisms, but these defenses can negatively affect fitness when individuals forgo foraging and reproductive opportunities. Although many studies have focused on the costs associated with antipredator behavior, few have evaluated how that behavior changes immediately following a nonlethal interaction with a predator. Understanding how differences in species ecology (i.e., autotomy and regeneration capabilities) influence antipredator behaviors prior to and following a predation attempt could provide insight into how animals cope with living among predators. In this study, we evaluated the antipredator and compensatory behaviors of Northern Zigzag Salamanders (Plethodon dorsalis) to determine how attempted predation affects behavioral responses to perceived predation risk. In a laboratory setting, we performed behavioral assays evaluating escape distance, exploratory movements, cover use, eating habits, and temperature preferences on individuals assigned to attacked (tail autotomy) and control treatments. We found differences in antipredator and compensatory responses between the two treatments, indicating that responses change relative to previous experiences with predators and present risk of predation. Our results indicate that attacked individuals had lower thresholds to elicit a behavioral response relative to control individuals and compensated for loss of resources and decreased locomotive ability by selecting warmer-temperature microhabitats. This study provides insight into how individuals cope with living amongst predators and emphasizes the need to explore behavioral changes following predation.

AU  - Branco, L. G.
T2  - The American Journal of Physiology
AB  - The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that hypoglycemia induces hypothermia in ectotherms and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for behavioral hypothermia. Behavioral hypothermia is a stress response that occurs in organisms ranging from protozoans to mammals, but very little is known about the cellular mechanisms involved. Toads equipped with a temperature probe were tested in a thermal gradient (10-40 degrees C). Insulin was used to reduce plasma glucose levels, and an inhibitor of glucose utilization, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), was used to cause intracellular glucopenia. Insulin injections into the dorsal lymph sac caused significant reductions of both plasma glucose levels and body temperature. To determine if the response was mediated by extracellular glucose receptors or an intracellular mechanism. 2-DG was also injected into the lymph sac. 2-DG caused a similar drop in body temperature and a marked increase in plasma glucose. To assess the role of central thermoregulatory mechanisms, a smaller dose of 2-DG was injected into the fourth cerebral ventricle or the lymph sac. Intracerebroventricular injection of 2-DG caused a decrease in body temperature despite elevated circulating glucose levels, whereas injection into the lymph sac caused no significant change. The data indicate that exclusion of glucose from central rather than peripheral sites plays a major role in the hypoglycemia-induced behavioral hypothermia and that intracellular mechanisms rather than extracellular glucose receptors are involved in this response. Hypothermia may be a beneficial response to hypoglycemia in toads because it dampens cellular oxidative demands during glucose deprivation.

AU  - Branco, L. G.
AU  - Malvin, G. M.
T2  - The American Journal of Physiology
AB  - An important adaptation to hypoxia is a regulated reduction in body temperature (Tb; anapyrexia), presumably because it lowers metabolic rate when oxygen supply is limited. Although this beneficial response occurs in organisms ranging from protozoans to mammals, little is known of the cellular mechanisms involved. We showed previously that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation mediates hypoxia-induced anapyrexia in the paramecium. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation also causes anapyrexia in a vertebrate, Bufo marinus. Tb in toads was measured in a thermal gradient 24 h before and 24 h after administration of either NaCN or NaN3, both inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. Subcutaneous NaCN (0.6 mmol/kg) reduced Tb from 29.1 +/- 0.8 to 19.6 +/- 0.6 degree C (P = 0.002). Infusion of NaCN (0.6 mumol/kg) into the fourth ventricle of the brain reduced Tb from 30.0 +/- 0.9 to 24.8 +/- 1.2 degrees C (P = 0.01). Responses to NaN3 were similar to the NaCN responses. Control injections and subcutaneous injections of 0.6 mumol/kg NaCN and NaN3 had no significant effect on Tb (P > 0.32). Neither NaCN nor NaN3 had significant effects on arterial PO2, PCO2, or pH at 26 degrees C. These results indicate that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in the central nervous system leads to the selection of cooler temperatures. Thus reduced oxidative phosphorylation within the brain may be an important factor eliciting hypoxia-induced anapyrexia.

AB  - Hypoxia induces a regulated decrease in body temperature (Tb; anapyrexia) in organisms ranging from protozoans to mammals, but very little is known about the mechanisms involved. Several candidates have been suggested to mediate hypoxia-induced anapyrexia, among them lactate, which is a classical companion of hypoxic stress in vertebrates. The present study was designed to assess the central thermoregulatory effects of lactate in Bujo paracnemis. Toads equipped with a temperature probe were tested over a thermal gradient (10–40°C). Lactate injected systemically (4.0 mmol kg−1) caused a significant reduction of Tb from 24.6±2.1 to 17.4±3.9°C. To assess the role of central thermoregulatory mechanisms, a lower dose (0.4 mmol kg−1) of lactate was injected into the fourth cerebral ventricle or systemically. Intracerebroventricular injection of lactate caused a similar decrease in Tb, whereas systemic injection caused no change. The data indicate that lactate may play a role in hypoxia-induced anapyrexia in central rather than peripheral sites.

TI  - Role of central chemoreceptors in behavioral thermoregulation of the toad, Bufo marinus
AU  - Branco, L. G.

T2  - The American Journal of Physiology
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that hypercapnia will induce behavioral hypothermia in toads and that central chemoreceptors are involved in this response. Animals were tested in an enclosed temperature gradient supplied with different gas mixtures. Fractional inspired CO2 (FICO2) between 0 and 0.05 had no significant effect on selected body temperature, but FICO2 between 0.06 and 0.10 reduced the selected body temperature from U approximately 28 to 18 degrees C. To determine if the hypercapnia-induced hypothermia is mediated by acidification of central chemoreceptors, the pH of the fourth ventricle was kept constant by perfusion with mock cerebrospinal fluid of pH 7.7 or 7.1 (normal and acidic values, respectively). Ventricular perfusion at pH 7.7 under normocapnic conditions had no effect on body temperature. Hypercapnia (FICO2 0.08) failed to induce hypothermia when the fourth ventricle was kept at pH 7.7 and when hyperoxia was present. Acidic ventricular perfusion under normocapnic conditions decreased selected body temperature from 27 to 25 degrees C, a significant drop but much less than that due to hypercapnia producing the same brain pH, suggesting an important role of peripheral chemoreceptors. The physiological significance of behavioral hypothermia and nature of the peripheral stimulus were evaluated by measuring the effect of hypercapnia on arterial oxygen saturation, PO2, and pH at 15 and 25 degrees C. Arterial oxygen saturation was higher at the lower temperature. Increasing FICO2 decreased oxygen saturation at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C. Arterial PO2 increased with increasing inspired CO2. This increase was greater at 15 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Arterial pH decreased at both temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The concept that hypoxia elicits a drop in body temperature (T(b)) in a wide variety of animals is not new, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that adenosine mediates hypoxia-induced hypothermia in toads. Measurements of selected T(b) were performed using a thermal gradient. Animals were injected (into the lymph sac or intracerebroventricularly) with aminophylline (an adenosine receptor antagonist) followed by an 11-h period of hypoxia (7% O(2)) or normoxia exposure. Control animals received saline injections. Hypoxia elicited a drop in T(b) from 24.8 +/- 0.3 to 19. 5 +/- 1.1 degrees C (P < 0.05). Systemically applied aminophylline (25 mg/kg) did not change T(b) during normoxia, indicating that adenosine does not alter normal thermoregulatory function. However, aminophylline (25 mg/kg) significantly blunted hypoxia-induced hypothermia (P < 0.05). To assess the role of central thermoregulatory mechanisms, a smaller dose of aminophylline (0.25 mg/kg), which did not alter hypoxia-induced hypothermia systemically, was injected into the fourth cerebral ventricle. Intracerebroventricular injection of aminophylline (0.25 mg/kg) caused no significant change in T(b) under normoxia, but it abolished hypoxia-induced hypothermia. The present data indicate that adenosine is a central and possibly peripheral mediator of hypoxia-induced hypothermia.

AU  - Carey, Cynthia

AB  - Factors influencing levels and rates of variation of body temperature (T b) in montane Bufo boreas boreas and in lowland Bufo boreas halophilus were investigated as an initial step toward understanding the role of natural thermal variation in the physiology and energetics of these ectothermic animals. Body temperatures of boreas can vary 25-30° C over 24-h periods. Such variation is primarily due to both nocturnal and diurnal activity and the physical characteristics of the montane environment. Bufo boreas halophilus are primarily nocturnal except during breeding and are voluntarily active at body temperatures ranging between 10 and 25° C. Despite variation in T b encountered in the field, boreas select a narrow range of T b in a thermal gradient, averaging 23.5 and 26.2° C for fasted individuals maintained under field conditions or acclimated to 20° C, respectively. In a thermal gradient the mean T b of fasted halophilus acclimated to 20° C is 23.9° C. Skin color of boreas varies in the field from very dark to light. The dark skins absorb approximately 4% more radiation than the light ones. Light colored boreas should absorb approximately 5% more radiation than similarly colored halophilus. Evaporative water losses increase directly with skin temperatures and vapor pressure deficit in both subspecies. Larger individuals heat and cool more slowly than smaller ones. Calculation of an enery budget for boreal toads suggests that they could sit in direct sunlight for long periods without fatally overheating, providing the skin was continually moist.

AB  - Forest removal is a global threat to amphibian diversity. Declines occur within these areas, but many amphibians also avoid moving into or through disturbed areas. Understanding which cues result in avoidance may provide targets for preservation of amphibian occupancy and population connectivity. Negative phototaxis is known from many amphibians, but light can serve as a cue or as a proxy for other environmental cues like temperature. This study sought to evaluate whether larval salamander habitat selection was influenced most by light or temperature cues. Because some individuals choose to remain in deforested habitat, we also assessed whether differences in habitat selection existed between individuals from forested and deforested habitat. Using a laboratory experiment, we found that salamanders use both light and temperature cues for habitat selection. Although salamanders demonstrated larger responses to temperature, they were willing to move into warmer habitats to avoid light. Individuals from deforested regions preferred brighter and warmer areas than individuals from forested regions although plasticity was higher with respect to light relative to temperature. We also noted that salamander thermal preferences were lower than daytime temperatures in small (&lt; 60 m) deforested regions. Overall, a combination of light and thermal cues following forest removal may contribute to avoidance of deforested regions, but more research is necessary to understand why some salamanders continue to occupy warm and bright-disturbed areas.

AU  - Clemente, Amanda Copriva [UNESP
AB  - Ectothermal animals depend primarily on behavioral adjustments coupled with the exploration of external heat sources to regulate body temperature (Tb). In addition, Tb variations can significantly affect the physiology of ectothermic organisms influencing important aspects of their reproduction, metabolism, feeding and digestion, among others. Thus, thermoregulation is a central aspect of the biology of ectothermal animals. In ectothermalvertebrates it is common for animals to have a preference for a particular temperature or temperature range, which is called the preferred body temperature (Tpref). This preference, however, can be altered in function of external factors or the condition of the animals. For example, fed animals generally exhibit an increase in Tpref - referred to a postprandial thermophilic response - which potentially improves food digestion performance. This response is relatively well documented in Squamata, but among anuran amphibians, information on its occurrence, magnitude and possible determinants is scarce. Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether the cururu toad, Rhinella diptycha, changes its thermal preference after being fed with a prey with a mass equivalent to 15% of its body mass. For this, fed and fasted animals were maintained for eight consecutive days in a thermal gradient with temperatures ranging from 15ºC to 30ºC. During this period, the Tb of the frogs was continuously monitored with temperature sensors (iButtons®) implanted intraperitoneally. The Tpref values of the fed animals increased to levels significantly higher than the Tpref values of fasted animals on the second day after feeding and that difference was maintained until the end of the experiments. The occurrence of a postprandial thermophilic response in R. diptycha indicates that this species is able to adjust its thermoregulatory behavior as a function of feed, possibly improving digestion efficiency

AB  - Parasites typically have broader thermal limits than hosts, so large performance gaps between pathogens and their cold- and warm-adapted hosts should occur at relatively warm and cold temperatures, respectively. We tested this thermal mismatch hypothesis by quantifying the temperature-dependent susceptibility of cold- and warm-adapted amphibian species to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using laboratory experiments and field prevalence estimates from 15 410 individuals in 598 populations. In both the laboratory and field, we found that the greatest susceptibility of cold- and warm-adapted hosts occurred at relatively warm and cool temperatures, respectively, providing support for the thermal mismatch hypothesis. Our results suggest that as climate change shifts hosts away from their optimal temperatures, the probability of increased host susceptibility to infectious disease might increase, but the effect will depend on the host species and the direction of the climate shift. Our findings help explain the tremendous variation in species responses to Bd across climates and spatial, temporal and species-level variation in disease outbreaks associated with extreme weather events that are becoming more common with climate change.

AB  - Los anfibios son organismos ectotermos por lo que sus procesos fisiológicos y de comportamiento dependen de la temperatura. Craugastor loki es una rana que se distribuye ampliamente, desde el estado de Veracruz en México hasta Honduras, en un rango altitudinal que va desde el nivel del mar hasta los 2000 metros de elevación.
El objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar sus requerimientos térmicos en distintas localidades de la Sierra Madre de Chiapas e identificar si estos requerimientos varían entre localidades y altitud, además determinar cuáles son las estrategias termorreguladoras que emplean para hacer frente a las condiciones que experimentan en los distintos ambientes que ocupan. Se realizaron correlaciones y regresiones lineales de la temperatura corporal entre la temperatura del sustrato, temperatura del ambiente y altitud. Así mismo se comparó la temperatura corporal, temperatura de selección, precisión termoregulatoria y calidad térmica del ambiente entre las distintas localidades mediante análisis de varianza. Se encontró que la temperatura corporal de Craugastor loki disminuyó conforme aumentó la altitud, y mostró una estrecha relación con la temperatura del sustrato y ambiente.

AB  - Development rate and temperature selection were monitored in groups of bullfrog tadpoles during periods from early summer to early winter. After collection, the tadpoles were placed in 25°C tanks with long (16L:8D), short (8L:16D), and natural photoperiods. Developmental stages (Taylor-Kollros) were assessed at approximately 3-d intervals, and temperature selection at approximately 1-wk intervals. For the first 2 wk in the 25°C tanks, development was rapid (0.4 stages· d⁻¹) in early and midsummer but very slow (0. 02 stages· d⁻¹) in early winter. During this initial 2-wk period, the temperatures selected in early and midsummer (28.4°C) were higher than those selected in early winter (24.0°C). After 2 wk in the 25°C tanks, the long-photoperiod group (relative to the short-photoperiod group) showed a slight decrease in development in early summer, no difference in midsummer, and a definite increase in early winter. Temperature selection was not altered by photoperiod length. These results suggest that endogenous annual rhythms for development and temperature selection are present in Rana catesbeiana tadpoles.

AB  - Ozone (O3) is a strong pulmonary irritant and causes a suite of respiratory tract inflammatory responses in humans and other mammals. In addition to lung injury, rodents exposed to O3 exhibit a pronounced decrease in core body temperature at rest, which may offer a protective effect against O3 damage. The effects of O3 on other vertebrates have not been studied. Compared to individuals exposed to air (N=34), Bufo marinus toads exposed to O3 (N=32) for 4 h lost 3.78 g body mass (adjusted mean from analysis of covariance, body mass mean±SD, 90.1±21.90 g). We tested the thermoregulatory responses of 22 toads in a thermal gradient 1, 24, and 48 h after 4-h exposure to air (N=11) or 0.8 ppm O3 (N=11). Individual toad thermal preferences were also significantly repeatable across all trials (intraclass correlation=0.66, P <0.001). We did not observe a direct effect of O3 exposure on the preferred body temperatures (PBT) of toads. However, O3 exposure did have an indirect effect on selected temperatures. Ozone-exposed toads with higher evaporative water loss rates, in turn, also selected lower PBT, voluntary minimum, and voluntary maximum temperatures 24 h post-exposure. Ozone exposure may thus alter both water balance and thermal preferences in anuran amphibians.

AB  - Physiological functions of ectotherms and thus their performance depend on environmental temperatures. Many ectotherms are capable of active thermoregulation, e.g. by selecting suitable microhabitats. However, this may be constrained by unavailability of favourable microhabitats or high energetic costs of thermoregulation. Thus, to achieve the optimal performance levels, adaptations to local thermal environments are of great importance. Due to the inability of leaving their aquatic habitat, larval anurans should especially benefit from local thermal adaptations. Rana temporaria is a widely distributed European anuran species, inhabiting a range of microhabitats, which makes it an excellent model to study the potential of local thermal adaptation. We raised R. temporaria tadpoles from Germany and Croatia under respective natural temperature fluctuations and three constant temperatures (15°, 20° and 25°C), and tested dependency of their thermal preferences on the developmental stage and temperature regime, and the population origin. Tadpoles of both origins selected higher temperatures towards the end of the developmental period, and their thermal preferences were affected by the developmental temperature. However, regardless of the developmental stage or treatment, tadpoles from warmer Croatia selected higher temperatures than tadpoles from colder Germany. This demonstrates the tendency of adjusting the sensitivity of physiological processes to local thermal conditions.

AB  - 1.Behavioural temperature regulation (seeking of a thermopreferendum) of frogs (Rana esculenta) has been studied in an aqueous thermal gradient during selective heating of the spinal cord.2.These experiments confirmed that the mean thermopreferendum in this species is about 26° C without spinal cord heating.3.After spinal heating frogs chose a colder ambient temperature. This decrease of the thermopreferendum was proportional to the heating power dissipated in the thermode.4.A similar behavior has been obtained after complete denervation of the dorsal skin. Therefore the change in thermopreferendum was triggered by deep thermal receptors.5.The measurement of colonic, cephalic, brain and spinal temperatures showed that only the spinal region was heated by the thermode. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the behaviour was triggered by spinal thermoreceptors.6.During spinal heating the spinal temperature does not surpass 35° C. Everything is as if the frog behaviour prevented internal temperature from surpassing 35°C.7.As in mammals and birds it is reasonable to assume the existence of a warm sensitivity in the spinal cord of ectothermes. This sensitivity gives rise to a thermoregulatory behaviour.

TI  - Determining the feasibility of a translocation by investigating the ecology and physiology of the threatened Hochstetter's frog (Leiopelma hochstetteri)
AU  - Easton, Luke
AB  - Habitat modification is one of the largest threats to amphibians worldwide, yet research investigating habitat modification impacts and management responses is often limited. Consequently, there is a necessity to address such issues, particularly for rare Hochstetter’s frog (Leiopelma hochstetteri) populations that inhabit mature pine plantations in New Zealand. Fortunately, small populations at Torere Forest (Bay of Plenty, North Island) have received conservation attention following concerns over future pine harvesting. Possible management options are still in their infancy, but it is likely that a mitigation translocation via assisted colonisation will be required, even though a large-scale translocation for Hochstetter’s frogs has not occurred before. Orokonui Ecosanctuary (Dunedin, South Island) was selected as a potential translocation site primarily because future global warming scenarios suggest that southern regions may become more favourable for Hochstetter’s frogs than in their northern current distribution. However, the current cool climate at Orokonui Ecosanctuary is a concern as studies have concluded that Hochstetter’s frog populations are strongly associated with warm climates that frequently reach 20˚C or more. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to investigate how Hochstetter’s frog populations and individuals are influenced by a modified environment and to assess whether a translocation to Orokonui Ecosanctuary is indeed feasible regarding identifying suitable areas of habitat and the effect of a cool climate on frogs. 
In order to address these aims, this study examined population parameters and individual fitness, and the resource selection of Hochstetter’s frogs between mature pine plantations and native forests, followed by identifying suitable areas of habitat in Orokonui Ecosanctuary. The quality of the thermal environment at Torere Forest and Orokonui Ecosanctuary was also measured, along with the thermal preference and physiology of captive frogs exposed to cool temperatures. Overall, there were no differences in population parameters and individual body condition between the habitats, which suggested that mature pine plantations may not negatively affect populations and might even provide essential habitat. As for resource selection, the most important resources used by Hochstetter’s frogs were cobble habitat and logs, particularly in pine plantations. These resources were available in Orokonui Ecosanctuary, thus suitable areas of habitat were predicted to be present. However, results from the lab suggested that the thermal environment at Orokonui Ecosanctuary may be thermally challenging for Hochstetter’s frogs, particularly considering captive frogs mainly preferred temperatures between 15.3 - 20.9 ˚C (central 50%) and were unable to digest slaters in cool conditions. Digestion of crickets and locusts did occur however, whilst temperatures were reduced during the acclimation period. Furthermore, gut retention times and weights increased in cool conditions, which highlighted that temperature largely influences these physiological responses. Nevertheless, studies have shown that Hochstetter’s frogs may exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour to optimise the thermal environment. Such behavioural responses are useful as Hochstetter’s frogs often inhabit shallow substrata where thermal conditions are possibly near or at equilibrium with cold temperatures during winter. Moreover, given their generalist diet and often low proportions of slaters ingested, results from this study suggest that energy uptake may occur during winter and that digestion of major dietary components might not be largely affected by cold temperatures.
A translocation to Orokonui Ecosanctuary therefore seems feasible, but further investigations are necessary. Further, management tools such as long-term monitoring, trial transfers, and continued stakeholder support are essential for conserving the Hochstetter’s frog populations in Torere Forest. In doing so, the management of these populations will provide a foundation for the future conservation of this threatened species, especially regarding translocations that are yet to occur.

AB  - Adaptation to warming climates could counteract the effects of global warming. Thus, understanding how species cope with contrasting climates may inform us about their potential for thermal adaptation and which processes may hamper that ability (e.g. evolutionary trade‐offs, phenology or behavioural thermoregulation). In addition to temperature, time constraints may also exert important selective pressures. Here, we compare the thermal sensitivity of locomotion of metamorphic and adult European common frogs (Rana temporaria) originating from populations along an elevational gradient. We employed the template mode of variation (TMV) analysis to decompose the thermal sensitivity of locomotion and explore the existence of trade‐offs (‘hotter is better’ and ‘specialist–generalist’) and the degree of local adaptation. To that end, we studied the relationship between TMV parameters and local environmental conditions. Further, we compared preferred temperatures to assess whether behavioural thermoregulation could dampen the effects of thermal variation, reducing the intensity of selection and limiting thermal adaptation (i.e. ‘Bogert effect’). We suggest that behavioural thermoregulation has promoted the conservatism of thermal sensitivity in R. temporaria. Yet, we observed a trend towards narrower thermal niches shifted towards warmer temperature in populations with severe temporal constraints, conforming to the ‘generalist‐specialist’ trade‐off. Apparently, this enables time‐constrained populations – especially in the case of metamorphs – to effectively exploit resources during the warmest periods. The limited potential of R. temporaria for thermal adaptation suggests that forecasts of global warming should incorporate thermoregulation and explore its potential to buffer species from rising temperatures.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Parasites can enhance their fitness by modifying the behavior of their hosts in ways that increase rates of production and transmission of parasite larvae. We used an antihelminthic drug to experimentally alter infections of lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) in cane toads (Rhinella marina). We then compared subsequent behaviors of dewormed toads versus toads that retained infections. Both in the laboratory and in the field, the presence of parasites induced hosts to select higher body temperatures (thereby increasing rates of lungworm egg production), to defecate in moister sites, and to produce feces with higher moisture content (thereby enhancing survival of larvae shed in feces). Because those behavioral modifications enhance rather than decrease parasite fitness, they are likely to have arisen as adaptive manipulations of host behavior rather than as host adaptations to combat infection or as nonadaptive consequences of infection on host physiology. However, the mechanisms by which lungworms alter cane toad thermal preference and defecation are not known. Although many examples of host manipulation by parasites involve intermediate hosts facilitating their own demise, our findings indicate that manipulation of definitive hosts can be as subtle as when and where to defecate.

TI  - Variation in Temperature Preference with Stage of Development of Bufo marinus Larvae
AU  - Floyd, Robert B.
T2  - Journal of Herpetology
AB  - The temperature preference of Bufo marinus larvae was determined at six stages of development. At stage 37 the temperature preference of the larvae was also determined at each of three acclimation temperatures. Preferred temperature generally increased as larval development progressed. This trend was compared with the thermal tolerance at different stages of development. There was no significant correlation between temperature tolerance and temperature preference. The temperatures experienced by tadpoles in nature as they select different microhabitats at different stages of development showed a trend similar to the temperature preferences. Different acclimation temperatures at stage 37 had no effect on temperature preference.

AB  - Ectotherms use behaviour to buffer effects of temperature on growth, development and survival. While behavioural thermoregulation is widely reported, localized adaptation of thermal preference is poorly documented. Larval amphibians live in wetlands ranging from entirely open to heavily shaded by vegetation. We hypothesized that populations undergo localized selection leading to countergradient patterns of thermal preference behaviour. Specifically, we predicted that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae from closed canopy ponds would be more strongly temperature selective and would prefer higher temperatures than conspecifics from populations found in open canopy ponds. In a study of six breeding ponds in north-eastern Connecticut, USA, these predictions were upheld. The countergradient, microgeographical variation in thermal preference documented here implies that wood frog populations may have diverged rapidly in the face of contrasting selection pressures. Rapid, behaviourally mediated responses to changing thermal environments have important implications for understanding population responses to climate change.

AB  - Temperature and humidity are critical factors for terrestrial lungless salamanders, as their body temperatures are largely determined by the environmental temperature and require moisture to sustain cutaneous respiration. Herein, we evaluated the preference of Bolitoglossa ramosi Brame and Wake, 1972 between a high temperature and a high relative humidity (RH), the influence of temperature on RH preferences, and the influence of RH on the thermal preferences. This study was performed in a field location in the municipality of Líbano, Tolima, Colombia. There, on different nights, we collected 84 adult B. ramosi and carried out the preference experiments, using aluminum troughs with different thermal and RH gradients. We found that between high temperature and high RH, B. ramosi preferred high RH. However, B. ramosi selected high temperatures when the gradient had a high RH and low temperatures when the gradient had a low RH. These results show that B. ramosi is able to thermoregulate and hydroregulate. Nevertheless, hydroregulation seems to be more important than thermoregulation because B. ramosi always selected the high RH gradients, while their thermal selection relied on the hydric environment.

T2  - Conservation Physiology
AB  - Relict leopard frog (Rana [Lithobates] onca) tadpoles were obtained shortly after hatching at Gosner stage 25 and raised in aquaria maintained at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C. Development was arrested in the 15°C group, and survivorship declined to 64% after 191 days. However, 80% of the surviving larvae remained alive after the temperature was increased to 25°C. Of these, 96% reached metamorphosis. Survivorship of the 20, 25 and 30°C acclimation groups was 82, 94 and 66%, respectively, whereas none survived at 35°C. Time to metamorphosis was significantly shorter for the 25°C group (67 ± 1 days), followed by the 30°C (98 ± 2 days) and 20°C (264 ± 7 days) groups. A linear 66 cm thermal gradient was used to identify temperature ranges selected by tadpoles in the different acclimation groups. Five 10°C gradients (10–20, 15–25, 20–30, 25–35 and 30–40°C) were used, and time spent in the cooler, middle and warmer thirds of the gradient was compared for 10 individuals from each acclimation group. In the coolest gradient, tadpoles from all acclimation groups selected the warmer third (&gt;17°C) of the gradient. In the warmer gradients, tadpoles from the 20 and 25°C acclimation groups selected temperatures &lt;29°C, while those from the 30°C acclimation group selected temperatures &lt;33°C. Maximal burst speed for all groups was greater at experimental temperatures of 25 than 15°C. Efforts to reintroduce this species to its historical range should select habitats where water temperatures between 25 and 30°C are available during the post-hatching period.

TI  - Does reproduction influence temperature preferences in newts?
AU  - Gvoždík, Lumír
T2  - Canadian Journal of Zoology
AB  - The influence of reproduction on body temperatures preferred in a laboratory thermal gradient has been studied mostly in ectotherms that are either viviparous or oviparous with prolonged egg retention. In this study I investigated whether reproduction influences temperature preferences in the Italian crested newt, Triturus carnifex (Laurenti, 1768), whose females do not carry embryos in utero (strict oviparity). I compared preferred temperatures and locomotor activity among reproductive females, non-reproductive females, and males in an aquatic thermal gradient (5–32.5 °C) over 24 h. Reproductive females preferred mean body temperatures 2.3–4.3 °C higher than those of non-reproductive females and males irrespective of activity level. Females regulated body temperature more precisely when reproductive than when non-reproductive as judged by the narrower range of preferred body temperatures. The study showed that the shift in temperature preferences of reproductive females occurs not only in species with advanced reproductive modes (i.e., viviparity and oviparity with egg retention), but also in a strictly oviparous mode.

TI  - Mismatch Between Ectotherm Thermal Preferenda and Optima for Swimming: A Test of the Evolutionary Pace Hypothesis
AU  - Gvoždík, Lumír
T2  - Evolutionary Biology
AB  - A continuing issue in evolutionary thermal biology is the mismatch between preferred body temperatures (Tpref) and optimal temperatures (Topt) for whole-animal performance. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, I examined the hypothesis that a difference in the rates at which Tpref and Topt evolve causes the mismatch in a lineage of European newts. In a laboratory thermal gradient, newts maintained body temperatures that were on average 8 °C below Topt for maximum swimming velocity. The lower boundary of the Tpref range evolved faster than the mean Tpref, the upper boundary of the Tpref range, and Topt. The strong evolutionary co-variation between mean Tpref and its boundaries prevented the shift of mean Tpref away from Topt. This suggests that the variation in evolutionary rates has a limited potential to modify the disparity between thermal optima and preferenda.

AU  - Gvoždík, Lumír

T2  - Journal of Experimental Biology
AB  - Temperature is an important factor determining distribution and abundance of organisms. Predicting the impact of warming climate on ectotherm populations requires information about species' thermal requirements, i.e. their so-called ‘thermal niche’. The characterization of thermal niche remains a complicated task. We compared the applicability of two indirect approaches, based on reaction norm (aerobic scope curve) and optimality (preferred body temperature) concepts, for indirect estimation of thermal niche while using newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, as a study system. If the two approaches are linked, then digesting newts should keep their body temperatures close to values maximizing aerobic scope for digestion. After feeding, newts maintained their body temperatures within a narrower range than did hungry individuals. The range of preferred body temperatures was well below the temperature maximizing aerobic scope for digestion. Optimal temperatures for factorial aerobic scope fell within the preferred body temperature range of digesting individuals. We conclude that digesting newts prefer body temperatures that are optimal for the maximum aerobic performance but relative to the maintenance costs. What might be termed the ‘economic’ thermoregulatory response explains the mismatch between thermal physiology and behaviour in this system.

T2  - Physiological and biochemical zoology: PBZ
AB  - Seasonal acclimation and thermoregulation represent major components of complex thermal strategies by which ectotherms cope with the heterogeneity of their thermal environment. Some ectotherms possess the acclimatory capacity to shift seasonally their thermoregulatory behavior, but the frequent use of constant acclimation temperatures during experiments and the lack of information about thermal heterogeneity in the field obscures the ecological relevance of this plastic response. We examined the experimentally induced seasonal acclimation of preferred body temperatures (T(p)) in alpine newts Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris subjected to a gradual increase in acclimation temperature from 5°C during the winter to a constant 15°C or diel fluctuations between 10° and 20°C during the spring/summer. Both the mean and range of T(p) followed the increase in mean acclimation temperature without the influence of diel temperature fluctuations. The direction and magnitude of this acclimatory capacity has the potential to increase the time window available for thermoregulation. Although thermoregulation and thermal acclimation are often considered as separate but coadapted adjustments to thermal heterogeneity, their combined response is employed by newts to tackle seasonal variation in a thermoregulatory-challenging aquatic environment.

AU  - Heath, Alan G.
T2  - Herpetologica
AB  - Several populations and life history stages of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, from elevations above 2890 m were studied in the field and laboratory. All groups selected the warmest water available in the ponds regardless of the actual temperature which rarely exceeded 25° C in the shallows. At night they moved into deeper water as the shallows cooled. In the laboratory aquatic thermal gradient, first year and older larvae tended to choose warmer temperatures (x̄ = 23.0°-25.5° C) than metamorphosed adults (x̄ = 18.4°-23.7° C). Furthermore, larvae and neotenic adults exhibited a narrower thermal preferendum than did metamorphosed adults. Behavioral thermoregulation may be particularly important in high altitude areas where the active growing season is short.

Activity and mean preferred temperatures were highest during scotophase and demonstrate the high degree of nocturnality of this species. The marked diel and seasonal cycles in thermal selection in many ectotherms suggest that the concept of a "final thermal preferendum" is not a particularly useful paradigm for descriptions of thermal behavior.

T2  - Copeia
AB  - Temperature selection and critical thermal maxima (CTM) were determined during larval development for Ambystoma texanum and A. maculatum and CTM for A. opacum. Larvae of A. texanum and A. maculatum maintained body temperatures in a gradient within a range of approximately 13 to 29 C with an overall mean of 22 C. Ambystoma maculatum larvae selected both the lowest and highest mean temperatures. Distinct modes of temperatures selected were found in 13 of 17 test groups and positions in the gradient were apparently attained by repetitive avoidance responses. Temperatures selected were positively correlated with size and acclimation histories but no interspecies differences were found. Larvae smaller than 14 mm SVL exhibited less random movement and responded slower to the temperature gradient although they were efficient at selecting temperatures during the first week after hatching. High temperatures were more precisely avoided in the gradient than cold. CTM was positively correlated with acclimation histories and size, and some interspecific differences were found. CTM values ranged from 28.1 to 37.9 C with A. maculatum having the lowest and highest CTM. CTM values appeared to reach a plateau in late developmental stages. Acclimation temperature appeared to have a greater affect on CTM in Ambystoma larvae than that previously reported for adults of this genus. Larvae of A. texanum and A. maculatum had significantly higher CTM than larvae of A. opacum; these differences are correlated with thermal conditions normally encountered by the individual species during larval development. It is suggested that increases in CTM are probably due in part to seasonal acclimatization in addition to stage of larval development.

AB  - Temperature plays a critical role in growth and development of anurans. Here, we investigated thermal preference of tadpoles from a wide-ranging anuran, Hyla chrysoscelis, by establishing an ex situ thermal gradient in a laboratory setting. We collected 64 tadpoles with a mean (±SD) body length of 12.2 ± 2.1 mm (range, 7–15 mm). Mean temperature preference of tadpoles ranged from 12.9 to 30.0°C, and we found a positive relationship between temperature preference and body length. Although body length is only one component of amphibian development, its apparent link with temperature preference is an exciting area for further research in this species as well as other species. Furthermore, given the broad distribution of H. chrysoscelis, there is an opportunity to investigate how thermal preferences could limit population edges and how populations may respond to shifts in environmental temperatures.

AB  - Ambient temperature largely determines the body temperature of amphibians, and thus their hydration state and physiological performance. Microhabitat conditions chosen by terrestrial amphibians may represent a trade-off between high ambient temperatures, which maximize performance but cause high rates of water loss, and low temperatures, which, in turn, slow desiccation, but potentially hinder performance. We determined the operative temperature of common frogs (Rana temporaria) by placing 3% agar models in different microhabitats and measuring their temperature and water loss. Temperature measurements derived from the models accurately matched the body temperature of live frogs placed in the same microhabitat. Operative temperatures were lower than ambient temperatures on a warm day, probably because of evaporative water loss, but they were similar to or even slightly higher than ambient temperatures on a cool day, possibly because of warmth from the substrate. Frogs in the field selected moist and cool habitats, and their body temperatures ranged from 15 to 21 °C. In a temperature gradient in the laboratory, captive frogs chose significantly higher temperatures (19.4±1.7 °C) when the gradient floor was covered entirely with wet sand than when sand was wet in the cool end, but dry in the warm end (17.6±2.5 °C). The relevance of the preferred temperature was assessed through jumping performance experiments, using frogs with different body temperatures. Jump length was lower at low body temperature (6 °C) than at higher body temperatures, and peaked at 15 °C. Our results suggest that the frogs select favourable microhabitats of intermediate temperature, which could result in reduced water loss and peak physiological and behavioural performance.

TI  - Influences environnementales précoces et plasticité phénotypique : étude d’un modèle amphibien avec soins parentaux prénataux, l’Alyte accoucheur
AU  - Lange, Léa
AB  - L’Alyte accoucheur (Alytes obstetricans) est une espèce d’amphibien où les soins parentaux sont réalisés par le mâle exclusivement. En effet, après l’accouplement, durant lequel le mâle participe activement à l’émission des oeufs, il attache sa ponte autour des articulations de ses membres postérieurs et la porte ainsi pendant tout le développement embryonnaire. Les amphibiens sont très sensibles à l’environnement abiotique, notamment aux conditions hydriques et thermiques. Pour éviter les températures extrêmes, ils peuvent thermoréguler comportementalement, par exemple en sélectionnant des refuges aux conditions microclimatiques favorables. Les Alytes accoucheurs ont montré une sélection de leurs refuges sur la base de leurs propriétés hydriques et thermiques. Les stades de développement précoces sont particulièrement sensibles à la température. Les parents peuvent alors réaliser des comportements parentaux pour en limiter les effets. Un effet phénologique paternel a été observé chez les Alytes accoucheurs, dont les mâles favorisent des températures plus élevées lorsqu’ils portent des oeufs. Les comportements parentaux sont cependant coûteux pour les adultes. Les Alytes accoucheurs ont présenté des performances de locomotion diminuées pendant le port des oeufs, ce qui pourrait induire une diminution de l’aptitude. De plus, les comportements parentaux influencent fortement le développement des jeunes. L’environnement thermique rencontré pendant le stade embryonnaire, et donc pendant la période de soins parentaux chez l’Alyte accoucheur, a eu des effets à court terme et des effets persistants sur la phénologie. L’environnement thermique rencontré pendant le stade larvaire peut également être déterminant. Chez l’Alyte accoucheur, l’environnement thermique postnatal a induit un basculement vers un développement pluriannuel lors d’un développement à 16°C, avec un hivernage au stade têtard, alors qu’il a été annuel lors d’un développement à 20°C et 24°C. L’environnement thermique postnatal a également impliqué des modifications morphologiques, physiologiques et comportementales. Enfin, une implication de la physiologie, et notamment de la fréquence cardiaque, a été observée tout au long du développement embryonnaire et larvaire des jeunes.

TI  - Effects of Bombesin on Behavioral Thermoregulation in the Bullfrog
AU  - Leger, James P.

T2  - Brain Behavior and Evolution
AB  - Bombesin is a member of a class of neuroactive chemicals that have potent thermoregulatory effects in ectothermic and endothermic vertebrate species. Bombesin-like peptides are found in the brains of ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates and have been implicated in the central nervous system modulation of behavioral thermoregulation. Amphibians rely on behavioral thermoregulation to maintain their body temperature within developmental stage-dependant critical limits. To investigate the influence of bombesin on behavioral thermoregulation, we examined the effects of central injections of bombesin on thermal habitat selection at different stages of bullfrog development. Tadpoles and adult male and female frogs were allowed to select a preferred temperature, within an aquatic thermal gradient, before and after receiving an intracerebroventricular injection of bombesin. In larval and adult female bullfrogs, bombesin administration caused a decrease in preferred temperature values. This effect was clearly dose-dependent in tadpoles. Bombesin effects were variable in adult males, probably due to an overriding stress response to handling exhibited by males. The bombesin-induced hypothermia was blocked by [D-Phe6, Des-Met14]-bombesin (6–14), ethyl amide, a bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonist. These data suggest that bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptors are functional in the central nervous system of larval and adult amphibians and that receptor binding can modulate thermoregulation. They raise the question: under what natural conditions is endogenous bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide released in the brain to activate thermoregulatory behavior?

AB  - Infectious diseases are major drivers of biodiversity loss. The risk of fungal diseases to the survival of threatened animals in nature is determined by a complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment. We here predict the risk of invasion of populations of threatened Mediterranean salamanders of the genus Lyciasalamandra by the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans by combining field sampling and lab trials. In 494 samples across all seven species of Lyciasalamandra, B. salamandrivorans was found to be absent. Single exposure to a low (1000) number of fungal zoospores resulted in fast buildup of lethal infections in three L. helverseni. Thermal preference of the salamanders was well within the thermal envelope of the pathogen and body temperatures never exceeded the fungus’ thermal critical maximum, limiting the salamanders’ defense opportunities. The relatively low thermal host preference largely invalidates macroclimatic based habitat suitability predictions and, combined with current pathogen absence and high host densities, suggests a high probability of local salamander population declines upon invasion by B. salamandrivorans. However, the unfavorable landscape that shaped intraspecific host genetic diversity, lack of known alternative hosts and rapid host mortality after infection present barriers to further, natural pathogen dispersal between populations and thus species extinction. The risk of anthropogenic spread stresses the importance of biosecurity in amphibian habitats.

AB  - The challenges posed by parasites and pathogens evoke behavioral as well as physiological responses. Such behavioral responses are poorly understood for most ectothermic species, including anuran amphibians. We quantified effects of simulated infection (via injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) on feeding, activity, and thermoregulation of cane toads Bufo marinus within their invasive range in tropical Australia. LPS injection reduced feeding rates in laboratory trials. For toads in outdoor enclosures, LPS injection reduced activity and shifted body temperature profiles. Although previous research has attributed such thermal shifts to behavioral fever (elevated body temperatures may help fight infection), our laboratory studies suggest instead that LPS-injected toads stopped moving. In a thermal gradient, LPS-injected toads thus stayed close to whichever end of the gradient (hot or cold) they were first introduced; the introduction site (rather than behavioral thermoregulation) thus determined body temperature regimes. Shifts in thermal profiles of LPS-injected toads in outdoor enclosures also were a secondary consequence of inactivity. Thus, the primary behavioral effects of an immune response in cane toads are reduced rates of activity and feeding. Thermoregulatory modifications also occur but only as a secondary consequence of inactivity.

T2  - Journal of Experimental Zoology
AB  - Two experiments were performed. The first tested the hypothesis that the toad, Bufo marinus, will select a lower ambient temperature under dry environmental conditions. This behavioral response would reduce evaporative water loss and facilitate survival on land. The second experiment measured the effects of temperature on evaporative water loss. In the first experiment, toads were placed in a thermal gradient (11–40°C) for 3 days. On days 1 and 3, water-filled dishes were placed along the temperature gradient and humid air was circulated through the chamber. On day 2, water dishes were removed, and dry air was circulated through the chamber. Body temperature (Tb) was recorded with a cloacal thermistor. Selected Tb was approximately 8.6°C lower during the dry conditions than during the humid conditions. The behavioral hypothermia took about 6 h to develop. In the second experiment, a reduction in Tb from 17.7 to 12.°C reduced evaporative water loss by 42%. Consequently, behavioral hypothermia of the toad is an important adaptation to dry environmental conditions.

AB  - Ectothermic vertebrates develop behavioral fever in response to bacterial products, with potential corresponding metabolic costs associated with immune stimulation. Although behavioral fever has been described in several taxa under laboratory conditions, some important questions regarding metabolic response to bacterial products at different temperatures and effectiveness of behavioral fever remain open. Many ectotherms, such as nocturnal anurans, may be active in the field at environmental conditions that restrict thermoregulation during the immune response. How does the metabolic response to bacterial products under ecologically relevant but unfavorable thermal field conditions compare to that measured in fever thermal preferendum? Additionally, are there differences in the partitioning of metabolic costs associated with immune stimulation and Arrhenius effect (biochemical reactions rate) at normal versus fever thermal preferendum? We compared the energy expenditure untreated and LPS-treated yellow Cururu toads (Rhinella icterica) at temperature corresponding to field activity during winter nights, and at normal and fever thermal preferendum. It was hypothesized that the metabolic response to LPS would be proportionally lower at higher body temperatures. To test these hypotheses, we measured temperature in the field during night using agar models, as well as normal and fever thermal preferendum of the toads within a thermal gradient. Subsequently, we measured the toad's metabolic rates at mean agar models temperature, as well as at normal and fever thermal preferendum. Lastly, we calculated the Metabolic response to LPS as the ratio between MRLPS/MRSaline in each of these mean temperatures. Our results show that metabolic rates do not increase in response to LPS at the agar models temperature typical of the winter nights under which theses toads maintain reproductive activity. Moreover, LPS treatment increased the metabolic costs relative to Arrhenius effects at normal thermal preferendum but not at fever thermal preferendum. In this way, metabolic response to LPS was comparative lower at fever than normal thermal preferendum in yellow Cururu toads.

AU  - O'Connor, Michael P.
AU  - Tracy, C. Richard
T2  - Copeia
AB  - Patterns of body temperatures of newly metamorphosed toads (Bufo woodhousei) were studied in the field and in the laboratory. In the field, environmental temperatures experienced by the juvenile toads varied from day to day and hour to hour. When average substrate temperatures were below 27 C, body temperatures closely resembled substrate temperature, but when substrate temperatures exceeded 28 C, body temperatures remained below substrate temperature. Analyses with biophysical models and behavior of juvenile toads suggest that the juveniles actively avoid high body temperatures. In a laboratory thermal gradient, juvenile toads selected body temperatures of 24-32 C, a range at which locomotory abilities are maximized. When deprived of food for 48 h, however, the toads selected significantly lower body temperatures (24-28 C) that would reduce metabolic demands. Similarly, when allowed to select temperatures in a thermal gradient constructed of dry sand, the toads selected lower body temperatures (17-20 C), presumably decreasing rates of evaporative water loss. This study suggests that the mechanisms and execution of thermoregulation in B. woodhousei are complexly interrelated with several aspects of the environment and the physiological state of the animal.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Many ectotherms employ diverse behavioral adjustments to effectively buffer the spatio-temporal variation in environmental temperatures, whereas others remain passive to thermal heterogeneity. Thermoregulatory studies are frequently performed on species living in thermally benign habitats, which complicate understanding of the thermoregulation–thermoconformity continuum. The need for new empirical data from ectotherms exposed to thermally challenging conditions requires the evaluation of available methods for quantifying thermoregulatory strategies. We evaluated the applicability of various thermoregulatory indices using fire salamander larvae, Salamandra salamandra, in two aquatic habitats, a forest pool and well, as examples of disparate thermally-constrained environments. Water temperatures in the well were lower and less variable than in the pool. Thermal conditions prevented larvae from reaching their preferred body temperature range in both water bodies. In contrast to their thermoregulatory abilities examined in a laboratory thermal gradient, field body temperatures only matched the mean and range of operative temperatures, showing thermal passivity of larvae in both habitats. Despite apparent thermoconformity, thermoregulatory indices indicated various strategies from active thermoregulation, to thermoconformity, and even thermal evasion, which revealed their limited applicability under thermally-constrained conditions. Salamander larvae abandoned behavioral thermoregulation despite varying opportunities to increase their body temperature above average water temperatures. Thermoconformity represents a favored strategy in these ectotherms living in more thermally-constrained environments than those examined in previous thermoregulatory studies. To understand thermal ecology and its impact on population dynamics, the quantification of thermoregulatory strategies of ectotherms in thermally-constrained habitats requires the careful choice of an appropriate method to avoid misleading results.

AB  - The Mojave Desert is characterized by hot dry summers and cold winters. The red-spotted toad (Bufo (Anaxyrus) punctatus) is the predominant anuran species; yet little is known of their thermal histories and strategies to avoid temperature extremes. We measured body temperature (Tb) in free-ranging adult toads across all four seasons of a year using implanted data loggers. There is marked individual variation in the temperatures experienced by these toads. As expected, toads generally escape extreme seasonal and diel temperature fluctuations. However, our data demonstrate a much wider estimated Tb range than was previously assumed. Though often for short periods, red-spotted toads do experience Tb as low as 3.1°C and as high as 39.1°C. All animals showed periods of prolonged thermal stability in cooler months and wider diel oscillations in warmer months. Red-spotted toad thermal history is likely a function of site choice; the exploitation of different refuges results in diverse thermal experiences. These data represent the most complete record of thermal experiences for a desert anuran and reveal greater extremes in body temperature than previously suggested.

AU  - Rocha, Priscila L

T2  - Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology
AB  - Hypoxia elicits a number of compensatory responses in animals, including behavioral hypothermia. The hypothesis that hypoglycemia induces hypothermia in the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana was tested and that this behavioral response would be beneficial. Frogs equipped with a temperature probe were tested in a thermal gradient (10–40°C). Insulin (15 IU kg−1) caused significant reduction of body temperature, from 25.0 to 17.8°C. A non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG, 50 mg kg−1),which blocks intracellular glucose utilization, was also injected and caused a similar drop in body temperature, despite an increase in plasma glucose levels. To assess the possible benefits of hypoglycemia-induced hypothermia, the effects of insulin and 2-DG injections were measured on plasma glucose concentration and on oxygen consumption of frogs equilibrated at 10, 20 and 30°C. The plasma glucose was elevated at higher temperatures and so was oxygen consumption. The insulin caused a significant reduction of plasma glucose concentration (about 1.22 μMol ml−1) whereas 2-DG caused a significant increase (about 0.70 μMol ml−1) at 30°C. Both drugs caused a reduction of oxygen consumption (approximately 0.388 and 0.382 ml min−1 kg at 30°C after insulin and 2-DG injection, respectively). No effect of either insulin or 2-DG was observed when the animals were equilibrated at 10°C. In conclusion, hypothermia may be a beneficial response to hypoglycemia in frogs.

AB  - We determined and compared the efficiency of thermoregulation of Rhinella arenarum in the Monte desert (Argentina) in two seasons, dry and wet. In the field, we measured body temperatures, micro-habitat temperatures and operative temperatures; while in the laboratory; we measured the selected body temperatures. Our results show a change in the thermoregulatory strategy of R. arenarum that is related to environmental constraints on their thermal niche. R. arenarum has the ability to be plastic and combine two strategies: (i) a moderate thermoregulator in the wet season, where thermal resources are available such that body temperature is maintained within the set points and physiologicial and behavioral processes are optimized; and (ii) a thermoconformer in the dry season where the thermal environment is more homogeneous and there is greater time invested in searching for food.

T2  - Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological Genetics and Physiology
AB  - We studied the variation of thermal parameters of Odontophrynus occidentalis between season (wet and dry) in the Monte desert (Argentina). We measured body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures, and operative temperatures; while in the laboratory, we measured the selected body temperatures. Our results show a change in the thermal parameters of O. occidentalis that is related to environmental constraints of their thermal niche. Environmental thermal constraints are present in both seasons (dry and wet), showing variations in thermal parameters studied. Apparently imposed environmental restrictions, the toads in nature always show body temperatures below the set point. Acclimatization is an advantage for toads because it allows them to bring more frequent body temperatures to the set point. The selected body temperature has seasonal intraindividual variability. These variations can be due to thermo-sensitivity of toads and life histories of individuals that limits their allocation and acquisition of resources. Possibly the range of variation found in selected body temperature is a consequence of the thermal environmental variation along the year. These variations of thermal parameters are commonly found in deserts and thermal bodies of nocturnal ectotherms. The plasticity of selected body temperature allows O. occidentales to have longer periods of activity for foraging and reproduction, while maintaining reasonable high performance at different temperatures. The plasticity in seasonal variation of the thermal parameters has been poorly studied, and is greatly advantageous to desert species during changes in both seasonal and daily temperature, as these environments are known for their high environmental variability.

AB  - We studied the thermophilic response to feeding of a typical desert adapted anuran from the Monte Desert. Our aim was to evaluate thermal changes in the selected body temperature of adult frogs of Pleurodema nebulosum, and measure the intestinal passage time, and food digestion. Our results show that after feeding, they selected higher micro-environmental temperatures ~ + 2 °C than frogs that remained starved. Pleurodema nebulosum would present a postprandial thermophilic response. The time of retention of food in the digestive tract was thermo-dependent, being lower in those individuals who were incubated at high temperatures (25 °C) compared to those subjected to lower temperatures (20 °C). Although we did not detect effects of temperature on digestive efficiency, the mass of faecal material indicates an increase at temperatures closer to the selected ones, suggesting that the defecation rate is influenced by temperature. Laiuoperinae frogs are characterized by explosive breeding behavior and fast growing rate. The digestive efficiency is essential for acquiring energy necessary for growth, reproduction and refuge-seeking, among others. In this framework, the differential selection of temperatures between moments of fasting and feeding allows the frogs to maintain a high digestive efficiency, maximizing the absorption of nutrients.

AB  - The ability of wildlife populations to mount rapid responses to novel pathogens will be critical for mitigating the impacts of disease outbreaks in a changing climate. Field studies have documented that amphibians preferring warmer temperatures are less likely to be infected with the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, it is unclear whether this phenomenon is driven by behavioural fever or natural variation in thermal preference. Here, we placed frogs in thermal gradients, tested for temperature preferences and measured Bd growth, prevalence, and the survival of infected animals. Although there was significant individual- and species-level variation in temperature preferences, we found no consistent evidence of behavioural fever across five frog species. Interestingly, for species that preferred warmer temperatures, the preferred temperatures of individuals were negatively correlated with Bd growth on hosts, while the opposite correlation was true for species preferring cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that variation in thermal preference, but not behavioural fever, might shape the outcomes of Bd infections for individuals and populations, potentially resulting in selection for individual hosts and host species whose temperature preferences minimize Bd growth and enhance host survival during epidemics.

AB  - Host behaviour is known to influence disease dynamics. Additionally, hosts often change their behaviours in response to pathogen detection to resist and avoid disease. The capacity of wildlife populations to respond to pathogens using behavioural plasticity is critical for reducing the impacts of disease outbreaks. However, there is limited information regarding the ability of ectothermic vertebrates to resist diseases via behavioural plasticity. Here, we experimentally examine the effect of host behaviour on ranaviral infections, which affect at least 175 species of ectothermic vertebrates. We placed metamorphic (temporal block 1) or adult (block 2) southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) in thermal gradients, tested their temperature preferences before and after oral inoculation by measuring individual-level body temperature over time, and measured ranaviral loads of viral-exposed individuals. We found significant individual-level variation in temperature preference and evidence for behavioural fever in both metamorphic and adult A. terrestris during the first 2 days after exposure. Additionally, we found that individual-level change in temperature preference was negatively correlated with ranaviral load and a better predictor of load than average temperature preference or maximum temperature reached by an individual. In other words, an increase in baseline temperature preference was more important than simply reaching an absolute temperature. These results suggest that behavioural fever is an effective mechanism for resisting ranaviral infections.

AB  - Despite the potential constraints imposed by cutaneous respiration and nocturnality, some salamanders actively thermoregulate when conditions permit. We measured substrate temperature selection in two species of Desmognathus in a moist thermal gradient in the laboratory. Desmognathus monticola selected significantly higher temperatures than Desmognathus quadramaculatus. Although the substrate temperatures selected by D. quadramaculatus did not vary over time (mean ± 1 SE = 13.6 ± 1.1 C), D. monticola selected significantly higher temperatures at night than during the day. Mean temperatures selected by D. monticola were 14.0 ± 1.5 C from 1200–1600 h and 19.7 ± 1.6 C from 2000–0000 h. This difference in temporal patterns is consistent with field behavior, because D. monticola is more frequently found away from water at night than is D. quadramaculatus.

AU  - Smolinský, R.

T2  - Journal of Zoology
AB  - Growth and development affect life-history traits, and consequently organismal fitness. The inevitable increase in body size during ontogeny is associated with changes in both resource use and predation risk, which results in the ontogenetic shift in habitat preferences. In this study, we examined whether the shift in preferred body temperatures (Tps) of newt larvae Triturus alpestris increases the Tps deviation of the most vulnerable stages (after hatching and during metamorphosis) from the Tps range of their main predator, dragonfly larvae Aeshna cyanea– the ‘predator-free temperatures’ hypothesis. Analyses of thermoregulatory behaviour in the laboratory thermal gradient showed that freshly hatched newt larvae maintained lower water temperatures than larvae in later stages, whose Tps largely fell into the Tps range of dragonfly larvae. With respect to the thermal quality of natural habitat, the anti-predator effectiveness of the Tps shift decreased during development. Water temperatures in natural habitats were located largely below the preferred body temperature range of both newt and dragonfly larvae, which limits their potential thermal niche partitioning. We conclude that factors other than predator avoidance drive the ontogenetic Tps shift in our model system.

AB  - The ability to modify phenotypes in response to heterogeneity of the thermal environment represents an important component of an ectotherm’s non-genetic adaptive capacity. Despite considerable attention being dedicated to the study of thermally-induced developmental plasticity, whether or not interspecific interactions shape the plastic response in both a predator and its prey remains unknown. We tested several predictions about the joint influence of predator/prey scents and thermal conditions on the plasticity of preferred body temperatures (Tp) in both actors of this interaction, using a dragonfly nymphs–newt larvae system. Dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna cyanea) and newt eggs (Ichthyosaura alpestris) were subjected to fluctuating cold and warm thermal regimes (7–12 and 12–22°C, respectively) and the presence/absence of a predator or prey chemical cues. Preferred body temperatures were measured in an aquatic thermal gradient (5–33°C) over a 24-h period. Newt Tp increased with developmental temperature irrespective of the presence/absence of predator cues. In dragonflies, thermal reaction norms for Tp were affected by the interaction between temperature and prey cues. Specifically, the presence of newt scents in cold regime lowered dragonfly Tp. We concluded that predator–prey interactions influenced thermally-induced plasticity of Tp but not in a reciprocal fashion. The occurrence of frequency-dependent thermal plasticity may have broad implications for predator–prey population dynamics, the evolution of thermal biology traits, and the consequences of sustaining climate change within ecological communities.

AB  - Relationships between behavioral regulation, environmental temperatures, and physiological tolerance are critical to conservation policy; however, these relationships may not be consistent among sister taxa. A species geographic range is influenced by various factors including physiological tolerance to temperature change. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature variation on thermal preference and standard metabolic rates (SMR) of two species of larval salamanders, Eurycea cirrigera (Southern Two-Lined Salamander) and Eurycea wilderae (Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander). These species share similar life histories, but E. cirrigera is broadly distributed and E. wilderae occupies a smaller range. We measured SMR using volume of oxygen consumption during closed-circuit respirometery trials conducted at 5°C increments between 5°C and 25°C. Standard metabolic rates were influenced by temperature, with a range of temperature-independent SMRs observed at those temperatures above each species laboratory-determined thermal preference. Concordant with their thermal preference (15.70°C) and more-narrow geographic range, E. wilderae exhibited a smaller scope of temperatures at which SMR was temperature-independent, relative to E. cirrigera, and metabolic rates were depressed at 25°C. Therefore, preferred thermal temperatures corresponded with physiological maxima and environmental temperatures in each species. Our results support the importance of behavioral thermoregulation in maintaining optimal physiological function. Further, these findings indicate that the physiological specialization that occurs in species of narrow geographic ranges may preclude favorable responses to changing environmental temperatures caused by land-cover changes, including loss of riparian forest in the Eastern United States.

AB  - Many animals respond to hypoxic stress by selecting cooler environments, the so-called ‘behavioural hypothermia’ response. Amphibians overwintering in ice-covered ponds and lakes offer an ecologically relevant test of this response since they must choose between the confounding metabolic effects of profound hypothermia or hypoxia; thermal and chemical conditions can vary from 0 °C and normoxic at the ice–water interface to 4 °C and markedly hypoxic at depths of 2–4 m. To mimic such environmental conditions, we constructed an experimental chamber that enabled continuous electronic surveillance of an animal’s movement along a thermal gradient. When Rana temporaria pre-acclimated to 3.5 °C were placed in a normoxic thermal gradient ranging from 0.8 to 8 °C, they invariably favoured the warmer end of the chamber. Upon exposure to hypoxia, however, their preferred temperature shifted from a median of 6.8 °C ( 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) to 1.9 °C . Metabolic rate measurements from animals exposed simultaneously to acute changes in water temperature and  suggest that movement to colder conditions in hypoxia effects the greatest metabolic savings and prolongs the onset of a plasma lactacidosis.

AB  - Red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) are model organisms for regenerative research. These animals can regenerate limbs, tails, jaws, spinal cords, as well as the lens of the eye. Newts are small ectotherms that are aquatic as adults; as ectotherms, they naturally conform to the temperature of their surroundings. Environmental temperatures, however, can increase or decrease the red-spotted newt's metabolic processes, including their rate of tissue regeneration; whether an optimal temperature for this rate of regeneration exists is unknown. However, newts do exhibit behavioral preferences for certain temperatures, and these thermal preferences can change with season or with acclimation. Given this flexibility in behavioral thermoregulation, we hypothesized that the process of tissue regeneration could also affect thermal preference, given the metabolic costs or altered temperature sensitivities of tissue regrowth. It was predicted that regenerating newts would select an environmental temperature that maximized the rate of regeneration, however, this prediction was not fully supported. Thermal preference trials revealed that newts consistently selected temperatures between 24 and 25°C throughout regeneration. This temperature selection was warmer than that of uninjured conspecifics, but was lower than temperatures that would have further augmented the rate of regeneration. Interestingly, regenerating newts maintained a more stable temperature preference than sham newts, suggesting that accuracy in thermoregulation may be more important to regenerating individuals, than to noninjured individuals.

In ectotherms, the environmental control over embryogenesis is often realized by changes in maternal thermoregulation during gravidity. To determine if reproduction influences thermoregulatory behavior in species where females lay eggs shortly after fertilization (strict oviparity), we compared preferred body temperatures (Tp) between reproductive (egg-laying) and non-reproductive female newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris. Next, we exposed reproductive females to temperatures mimicking Tp ranges of reproductive and non-reproductive individuals to find out whether the maternally modified thermal regime influences ovum and jelly coat volume, and early cleavage rates at the time of oviposition. In the thermal gradient, reproductive females maintained their body temperatures within a narrower range than non-reproductive individuals. The exposure of ovipositing females to temperatures preferred during their reproductive and non-reproductive period had a negligible influence on egg size and early cleavage rates. We conclude that the modification of maternal thermoregulatory behavior provides a limited opportunity to manipulate egg traits in newts.

AB  - We measured temperature preferences of 12 species of hylid frogs                         (Litoria and Cyclorana) from northern                     Australia in a laboratory thermal gradient. These species represented a range of                     ecological habitat use (aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal), adult body size                     (0.5–60 g), and cutaneous resistance to water loss                             (Rc = 0.6–63.1 s cm-1).                     We found significant differences among species in selected skin temperature and                     gradient temperature but not in the variances of these measures (an index of                     precision of temperature selection). The species’ differences correlated                     significantly with cutaneous resistance to water loss, with                     more‐resistant frogs selecting higher skin and substrate temperatures in                     the thermal gradient, even after phylogenetic relationships are taken into                     account. Because cutaneous resistance to water loss also correlates with                     ecological habit (arboreal > terrestrial > aquatic),                     we suggest that their higher resistance to water loss allows arboreal and                     terrestrial species better ability to tolerate high temperatures, where growth                     or locomotory speed may be higher, without the associated risk of                     desiccation.

AB  - Tadpoles and adults of American toads, Bufo americanus, were forced to sprint at different body temperatures. Tadpoles sprint at 80%, or better, of their maximal sprint rate between 17 and 36 C, whereas adults achieve the same performance level over a narrower range of 21-34 C. In a laboratory thermal gradient with a wet sandy substratum, presumably well-hydrated juvenile toads preferentially select body temperatures that tend to optimize sprint performance. In a thermal gradient with a dry substratum, presumably dehydrated juvenile toads select body temperatures that minimize loss of water. In a thermal gradient with both wet and dry substrata, juvenile toads generally remain on wet substrata and select temperatures available in those wetter environments at which they can best approach maximal sprint performance. They typically avoid dry substrata that would result in dehydration, even when those environments offer temperatures conducive to better sprint performance. Juvenile toads, owing to their diurnal habit and small body size, are more able than adults to regulate body temperature through behavioral selection of thermal microsites. Indeed, adult American toads in nature likely rarely achieve body temperatures necessary for optimal locomotor performance. We hypothesize that the thermal optimum for locomotion in B. americanus evolved in response to selective pressures on juveniles.

AB  - Temperature affects the physiological functions of ectotherms. To maintain optimal body temperature and ensure physiological performance, these organisms can use behavioral adjustments to keep the body temperature in their specific temperature range, so-called preferred temperature (Tpref). It is therefore crucial to describe and understand how Tpref vary within and amongst populations to predict the effects of climate change of altitudinal range shifts in organisms. We aimed at determining the altitudinal variations in Tpref in three ectothermic species (the Pyrenean brook salamander – a semi-aquatic and thigmothermic amphibian – the European common lizard and the wall lizard – both heliothermic species). Using an experimental approach where Tpref were measured along a temperature gradient in laboratory conditions, we used a cross-sectional approach to compare the variation of Tpref measured in populations sampled along the altitudinal gradient in the Pyrenees. We hypothesized a complex and highly variable intra-specific response of Tpref along geographical clines, with a positive relationship between Tpref and altitude (as predicted by the countergradient variation), the reverse pattern (referring to the adaptation of local optima hypothesis), or no relationship at all. Our results corroborated partially the countergradient hypothesis in the salamander (middle to high elevation part). At high altitude level, individuals may compensate for lower opportunities of favorable conditions by choosing a high temperature which maximizes their activities. However, populations from low elevation level hence better supported the adaptation of local optima hypothesis, such as both lizard species, for which Tpref tended instead to decrease with altitude. Lizards from cold climates may be physiologically adapted to low temperature, with the ability to reach optimal functioning at lower temperature than individuals from low altitude. Our findings suggest that predicting future niche models should therefore take into account the variability of Tpref, where species might be differently affected by global warming.

AB  - Jump performance in the frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis was measured                over body temperature range (Tb) of 2° to                37° C after acclimation at 9° and 30° C. Horizontal jump performance increased                linearly with Tb between 7° and 30° C but                declined markedly outside this range. There was no performance "plateau" over which                jump distance was relatively temperature-independent. The scale of the thermal                response (Q10 = 1.56) was similar to                temperature effects on locomotor performance in other amphibians and reptiles.                Acclimation regime did not significantly influence jump distance within the range of                Tb at which L.                   tasmaniensis is normally active. The optimal performance temperature,                between 30° and 33° C, was avoided in a thermal gradient. None of the descriptors of                thermal sensitivity examined (optimal temperature, optimum performance breadth,                preferred temperature, and acclimation response) correlates with the observed thermal                niche of L. tasmaniensis. Successful exploitation of temporally                variable thermal environments by anurans need not be associated with temperature                independence of locomotor performance around ecologically relevant                 Tb.

TI  - Influence of interspecific competitors on behavioral thermoregulation: developmental or acute plasticity?
AU  - Winterová, Barbora

T2  - Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology
AB  - Many ectotherms reduce their exposure to changing thermal conditions using behavioral thermoregulation. The effectiveness of behavioral thermoregulation in maintaining ectotherm body temperatures within the target range is influenced not only by environmental (operative) temperatures but also by the presence of other con- and heterospecific individuals. How species’ interactions affect behavioral thermoregulation is largely unknown. Theory predicts that species’ interactions could affect the plasticity of behavioral thermoregulation in two ways, i.e., by developmental plasticity of a preferred temperature range or by an acute shift in body temperatures. Empirical tests of these predictions are scarce. We examined the developmental and acute effects of heterospecific social interactions on the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation in the larvae of two competing species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. The presence of heterospecifics during larval development had no effect on preferred body temperatures but it modified later acute thermoregulatory responses to heterospecifics. Ichthyosaura alpestris larvae from heterospecific tanks increased their thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, while L. vulgaris larvae from conspecific tanks relaxed their thermoregulatory efforts. The thermal dependence of somatic growth suggests that modified behavioral thermoregulation has the potential to accelerate growth in competitively dominant I. alpestris. Acute thermoregulatory responses are affected by heterospecific social interactions in newt larvae, but not conspecific. A developmental plastic response modified body temperatures not the target thermoregulatory range, which shows that the influence of heterospecific social interactions is more complex than predicted by theory. Species interactions complicate estimating an ectotherm’s vulnerability to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Temperature selection in Rana cascadae tadpoles and adults was studied in the field and in the laboratory. In a mountain pond, temperatures spanned 8-30 C in the late afternoon and 5-12 C during the early morning. Tadpoles formed dense aggregations in the warmer portions of the pond during the afternoon and night and always selected the warmer portions of the pond. In the laboratory, studies in a temperature gradient showed that (1) premetamorphic tadpoles had high selected temperatures (27.3 ± 0.6 C); (2) early metamorphic tadpoles selected the warmest temperatures (28.8 ± 0.4 C) and had the lowest level of activity; and (3) late metamorphic tadpoles (19.0 ± 0.6 C), froglets (14.5 ± 0.4 C), and 2-yr-old adults (16.0 ± 0.6 C) selected much lower temperatures. Temperature selection in tadpoles acclimated to 7 C (CA) was compared with that of tadpoles acclimated to 21 C (WA). In premetamorphic and metamorphic tadpoles, the CA groups selected lower temperatures than the corresponding WA group. In contrast, little difference was found between the two acclimation groups in late metamorphic tadpoles. Temperature appears to play an important role in tadpole distribution. The variations in selected temperature for the different developmental stages presumably reflect changing physiological requirements and modes of environmental optimization during maturation.
